This retrospective investigation examined the effects of a combined Respiratory Muscle Training (cRMT) protocol upon speech intelligibility in persons post single cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

Methods The clinical data of 10 patients who requested speech therapy at a pro bono outpatient clinic for the diagnosis and treatment of dysarthria following a single stroke was utilized for this study. The intervention group was treated with three 5-minute sessions with cRMT each day for 28 consecutive days. The control group received no cRMT and no other therapeutic exercise intervention during the time period. Respiratory function and speech intelligibility were assessed pre- and post-intervention in terms of peak expiratory flow, subject self-perception of intelligibility, and word level intelligibility.

Results After 28 days of cRMT, the intervention group exhibited significant gains compared to the control group in peak expiratory flow (PEF) (IG: 73.12% vs CG: 4.66%), Self-Perception of Intelligibility (IG: 72.38% vs CG: 0.83%), and the word task of the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (AIDS) (IG: 43.92% vs. CG: 0%).

Conclusion These retrospective data demonstrate cRMT is a feasible and effective treatment for improving breath support and speech intelligibility in persons with dysarthric speech after single stroke.

This retrospective investigation examined the effects of a combined Respiratory Muscle Training (cRMT) protocol upon speech intelligibility in persons post single cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

Methods The clinical data of 10 patients who requested speech therapy at a pro bono outpatient clinic for the diagnosis and treatment of dysarthria following a single stroke was utilized for this study. The intervention group was treated with three 5-minute sessions with cRMT each day for 28 consecutive days. The control group received no cRMT and no other therapeutic exercise intervention during the time period. Respiratory function and speech intelligibility were assessed pre- and post-intervention in terms of peak expiratory flow, subject self-perception of intelligibility, and word level intelligibility.

Results After 28 days of cRMT, the intervention group exhibited significant gains compared to the control group in peak expiratory flow (PEF) (IG: 73.12% vs CG: 4.66%), Self-Perception of Intelligibility (IG: 72.38% vs CG: 0.83%), and the word task of the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (AIDS) (IG: 43.92% vs. CG: 0%).

Conclusion These retrospective data demonstrate cRMT is a feasible and effective treatment for improving breath support and speech intelligibility in persons with dysarthric speech after single stroke.

  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Background Dysarthria frequently occurs as a result of stroke and adversely impacts speech sound production, making it more difficult for the listener to understand what the person with dysarthria is attempting to communicate. This in turn may lead to social isolation, depression, and increased cost of care. Some studies have underscored the importance of respiratory muscle strengthening as it relates to improvement of speech intelligibility, However, the benefits of respiratory muscle training on dysarthric speech following stroke have not been explored. This retrospective investigation examined the effects of a combined Respiratory Muscle Training (cRMT) protocol upon speech intelligibility in persons post single cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

Methods The clinical data of 10 patients who requested speech therapy at a pro bono outpatient clinic for the diagnosis and treatment of dysarthria following a single stroke was utilized for this study. The intervention group was treated with three 5-minute sessions with cRMT each day for 28 consecutive days. The control group received no cRMT and no other therapeutic exercise intervention during the time period. Respiratory function and speech intelligibility were assessed pre- and post-intervention in terms of peak expiratory flow, subject self-perception of intelligibility, and word level intelligibility.

Results After 28 days of cRMT, the intervention group exhibited significant gains compared to the control group in peak expiratory flow (PEF) (IG: 73.12% vs CG: 4.66%), Self-Perception of Intelligibility (IG: 72.38% vs CG: 0.83%), and the word task of the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (AIDS) (IG: 43.92% vs. CG: 0%).

Conclusion These retrospective data demonstrate cRMT is a feasible and effective treatment for improving breath support and speech intelligibility in persons with dysarthric speech after single stroke.

                              </strong>
                              Dysarthria frequently occurs as a result of stroke and adversely impacts speech sound production, making it more difficult for the listener to understand what the person with dysarthria is attempting to communicate. This in turn may lead to social isolation, depression, and increased cost of care. Some studies have underscored the importance of respiratory muscle strengthening as it relates to improvement of speech intelligibility, However, the benefits of respiratory muscle training on dysarthric speech following stroke have not been explored. This retrospective investigation examined the effects of a combined Respiratory Muscle Training (cRMT) protocol upon speech intelligibility in persons post single cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

                              The clinical data of 10 patients who requested speech therapy at a pro bono outpatient clinic for the diagnosis and treatment of dysarthria following a single stroke was utilized for this study. The intervention group was treated with three 5-minute sessions with cRMT each day for 28 consecutive days. The control group received no cRMT and no other therapeutic exercise intervention during the time period. Respiratory function and speech intelligibility were assessed pre- and post-intervention in terms of peak expiratory flow, subject self-perception of intelligibility, and word level intelligibility.

                              After 28 days of cRMT, the intervention group exhibited significant gains compared to the control group in peak expiratory flow (PEF) (IG: 73.12% vs CG: 4.66%), Self-Perception of Intelligibility (IG: 72.38% vs CG: 0.83%), and the word task of the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (AIDS) (IG: 43.92% vs. CG: 0%).

                             Dysarthria causes distortions of speech sounds, decreasing the ability of the listener to comprehend the content and emotion messages the speaker intends to convey. Severe dysarthria can even render the affected person’s speech totally unintelligible.

                             Stroke-induced dysarthrias may restrict social interactions, leading to isolation and depression. However, the severity of dysarthric speech is not always congruent with the psychosocial impact, as even mild dysarthria may have a significant impact (

                             ). In contrast to the evidence for the psychosocial impact of dysarthria following stroke, the socioeconomic and financial burden appears largely uninvestigated. Although the cost of stroke and dysphagia is well documented, little investigation has been conducted with regards to the personal financial hardships and societal financial impacts of dysarthria (

Flaccid dysarthria typically results from lower motor neuron damage, and spastic dysarthria from upper motor neuron damage. Identification of dysarthria subtype can also guide treatment selection.

These factors can be evaluated through perceptual, acoustic, manometric, and palatographic means. One commonly used clinical tool with adult populations is the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (AIDS) (

                             The source data for this retrospective study was collected at a pro bono clinical speech-language pathology (SLP) clinic, which was run by the Office of Hispanic Ministry at a Catholic church in the greater Birmingham area of Alabama between 1998 and 2010. This study was granted an Institutional Review Board (IRB) exemption by the Western Institutional Board. All participants included in the study presented with dysarthria following a neurologist confirmed single CVA. The average amount of time between the onset of each participant’s stroke and referral to the pro bono SLP clinic was 4 weeks. As there was a lag between diagnosis and an available treatment opportunity, patients were offered a choice to be instructed in cRMT in the interim, which included explanation, demonstration, and return demonstration. Patients who accepted the offer underwent a four-week home-based intervention of cRMT using The Breather. Patients who chose to participate in the cRMT program were included in the intervention group (IG), while those who chose not to use the device while waiting for treatment were considered as the control group (CG) for analysis.

Furthermore, no other allied health therapy services which may have resulted in some degree of improvement of articulatory, vocal fold, or respiratory functioning (e.g. occupational therapy, physical therapy, respiratory therapy, music therapy, etc.) were administered during the study time period. Lastly, there were no changes in medications noted (e.g. changes in dosage, discontinuation, addition, etc.) during the study time period. Persons documented to have had an extension of CVA were excluded. Any patients who failed to meet one or more of the inclusion criteria were excluded from this study. The participants’ demographic data were reported by age and sex. Additionally, the specification of the hemisphere of CVA was reported.

                              The intervention resulting in the data used for this retrospective study focused on combined respiratory muscle training (cRMT) and was administered using THE BREATHER ®. Patients were instructed to sit upright, and to forcefully inhale and exhale through the device using diaphragmatic-abdominal breathing. If necessary, patients were advised to use a nose clip. If patients were unable to maintain a tight lip seal using the mouthpiece of the cRMT device, they were presented with the option to utilize a CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) facemask and received appropriate training. The duration of intervention was 28 days (4 weeks), and included three sessions per day. One session per week was supervised by a volunteer speech-language pathologist who was present for each of these weekly sessions. Each treatment day consisted of 3 sessions per day of up to 5 minutes of cRMT per session, as tolerated, judged by the patient’s report of fatigue or dizziness and the clinician’s assessment of patient fatigue. cRMT intensity was defined as the highest tolerated settings for both inhalation and exhalation. Settings for inhalation and exhalation were set independently from each other. Patient compliance and adherence to cRMT were assessed via patient communication during the weekly supervised intervention sessions. During the study duration, the control group patients by their own choice received no treatment.

                              To assess pulmonary function, we assessed expiratory peak flow (PEF) using a peak flow meter (Spir-O-Flow Peak Flow Pocket Monitor, Spirometrics) by taking the average of 3 trials as there is a correlation between expiratory peak flow and the pulmonary function required for speech intelligibility. Participants’ self-perception of their speech intelligibility was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a 100 mm horizontal line where “0” on the far left represented “My family and friends don’t understand anything I say” and “100” on the far right represented “My family and friends understand everything I say”. Participants judged their own speech intelligibility both pre- and post-treatment period by placing a vertical hash mark somewhere along the horizontal line. The clinician then measured the distance in millimeters from the left end of the horizontal line to the hash mark, so the speech intelligibility self-perception data is presented as a number from 0 to 100. Speech intelligibility at the word level was determined by administering the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (AIDS), which is an instrument designed to quantify speech intelligibility at the single word level and the sentence level (
                              <a id="xref-ref-63-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-63">

                              ). For the purposes of this retrospective pilot study, only the single word intelligibility was assessed for each participant. The tasks to assess speech intelligibility at the single word level utilizing the AIDS allows the examiner to require the dysarthric speaker to either read single words aloud or, whenever this is not possible due to comorbid visual-perceptual deficits and/or inadequate premorbid reading abilities, to imitate the examiner’s spoken model of each word assessed. Of these two methods, the former is considered to be the preferred method. Whichever method was employed in the initial assessment for a given participant on day 1 was also used for follow-up assessment on day 28 for that same participant. Regardless of method, each participant’s spoken samples were audio-recorded onto a digital recording device in a quiet room. The recorded samples were then provided to 2 blinded judges who were speech-language pathologists, neither of whom were the examiner. Each judge was provided with a data worksheet copied from the AIDS test manual. The judges were required to listen to each of the 50 words recorded by a given dysarthric speaker. As they listened to each word, the judges would select one word from a field of 12 written possible words on the data worksheet. Once completed, the examiner, using a key of what the actual word was for each of the 50 samples, would calculate the percentage of words correctly understood, which represented the speech intelligibility of the given dysarthric speaker at the word level at that one point in time. Next, the scores of the two judges were averaged to derive the average intelligibility of speech at the word level for data analysis in this study.

The primary research question was examined with one multivariate 2 × 2 factorial analyses of variance with repeated measures. The between-subjects independent variable was the experimental group (control vs. intervention) and the within-subjects independent variable was time (pretest vs. post test). The three dependent variables were the average of the three peak flow readings, the self-perception of intelligibility, and the word-level intelligibility task.

                               Average peak expiratory flow increased by 4.66% in the control group, while the intervention group showed an increase of 73.12% (p=.001), corresponding to an improvement of 64.2 liters per minute. Self perception of intelligibility improved by 72.38% in the intervention group, compared to 0.83% (p=.001) in the control group, as assessed by VAS.

                               further shows that the speech intelligibility at word level improved by 43.92% in the intervention group, while it did not improve in the control group (0%)(p=.004). These results demonstrate significant improvements across outcomes in participants who performed cRMT compared to those who did not. While the measurements for the participants in the control group remained essentially the same over time, participants in the experimental condition (cRMT) showed significant improvement over time.

                             This retrospective pilot study sought to determine the effectiveness of 4 weeks of 3 intensive brief daily sessions of cRMT on the speech intelligibility of stroke survivors with dysarthria. Compared to the control group whose data remained static, all of the participants in the experimental group showed positive gains after 4 weeks of cRMT in peak expiratory flow rate, self-perceived speech intelligibility, and speech intelligibility judged at the word level. As the sample size is limited, individual data points were illustrated (

                             This study is unique in its attempt to determine the potential effects of cRMT on speech intelligibility. A recent study found some improvements in selected respiratory dynamics as well as measures of voice perturbation in stroke patients using both inspiratory and expiratory RMT, but no reports of speech intelligibility improvement were included (

                             ). The improvements in respiratory peak flow and intelligibility measures in this study suggest that cRMT can have a significant impact on patients with stroke-induced dysarthria.

                             The direct effect of cRMT on peak flow on the participants in the intervention group was not unexpected given the nature and intensity of the training and existing data from other studies (

                             ). It is likely that the experimental group participants experienced an increase in both inspiratory strength (resulting in higher initial lung volumes for the task), and expiratory strength (allowing for higher expiratory flow volume for the task). Both or either of the two effects could potentially explain the average 73% increase in peak flow for the experimental group.participants may have simply improved at the peak flow task. It is also possible that the changes were simply due to a practice effect after spending 4 weeks using the device. However, if it were merely a byproduct of practice effect, then the intervention group’s observed improvement should not have resulted in a higher increase than the control group. Furthermore, improvement in peak expiratory flow has also been observed in numerous other studies involving RMT across disorders ((

                             Both the experimental participants’ self-perceived intelligibility and their average word-level intelligibility as perceived by two blinded judges increased significantly after the 4-week cRMT training regimen. However, there was a larger (72%) increase in the perception of their own intelligibility than in their word-level intelligibility increase (44%) as perceived by the judges. This is likely due to the marked difference between intelligibility judged at the word level and at the sentence or conversational level. At the word level, no contextual cues are available to aid a listener in comprehension. It is assumed that the participants in the intervention group had an increase in word-level intelligibility because they were speaking with a higher initial lung volume after practising taking more forceful inhalations. It is difficult to predict from these data what their sentence or conversation-level intelligibility would have been; it may have increased similarly due to speaking with higher lung volumes and the addition of linguistic context, but those gains may have been limited due to decreasing lung volumes across longer utterances. It is interesting from a psychosocial standpoint that the experimental participants reported a 72% percent increase in the perception of their own intelligibility; as they felt that others understood them with less difficulty, this points to the validity of using cRMT for improving the functional intelligibility of dysarthric speech. Given the correlation between dysarthria and health related quality of life, it can be presumed that improvement in speech intelligibility has a positive impact on the overall quality of life and social interactions (

                             It is possible as well that the gains in both measures of intelligibility occurred due to an increase in the participants’ baseline subglottal pressure, and therefore vocal intensity, for speech. It is clear from the LSVT literature (

While no speech tasks were directly targeted in this study, the carry-over effect from cRMT training to improved respiratory function and greater loudness during speech may be responsible for the positive gains seen in this study.

                             Despite the small sample size and retrospective nature of this study, the magnitude of the observed gains in peak flow and intelligibility measures are rather striking. The fact that the intelligibility measures improved to such a degree in the experimental group suggests that cRMT could be a viable treatment option for making functional gains in communication for patients with dysarthria. The cRMT device used in this study is an accessible and inexpensive option for treating dysarthria since the task has a relatively low cognitive load. It is important to note that the nature of the training protocol used here, involving a high effort task employed within a high-intensity treatment regimen over a short period of time, adheres to muscle training principles of intensity, specificity and increasing load over time (

                             ). As the same principles of muscle strengthening in response to resistance training apply to the respiratory muscles, it is likely that increased respiratory muscle strength due to cRMT caused the speech intelligibility improvements observed in this study.

                             There are several possible limitations to this study that warrant caution in interpreting the results. The relatively small sample size and retrospective nature of the study are first on this list. The fact that the two groups were similar in their makeup of specific dysarthria types was beneficial for group comparisons; however, the fact that both experimental and control groups had a heterogeneous mix of dysarthria types makes it difficult to generalize the results of the study to specific populations of patients with dysarthria. The next potential limitation is that no assessment was made of the level of general debility or mobility post-CVA as it is possible that the intervention group had an overall physical advantage compared to the control group and may have more easily benefited from respiratory muscle training. Several limitations to the retrospective design of this study are derived from the limitations of the original data set. For example, it does not contain a SHAM control and the subjects can not be randomized between groups.

                             This retrospective study analyzes the use of combined Respiratory Muscle Training (cRMT) with a hand-held device exercising both the muscles of inhalation and exhalation over a four week period revealing significant improvements in peak expiratory flow and speech intelligibility at the word level in the intervention group, as compared to the no treatment control group. In addition, this study also reveals superior patient perception with the intervention group in the domain of others understanding their speech. The present study therefore suggests the effectiveness and feasibility for the inclusion of cRMT in the treatment of persons who present with dysarthria after CVA. Our findings warrant a double blinded prospective, randomized sham-controlled study to verify these findings in a larger, more diverse population.
