  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Intensive farming practices can increase exposure of animals to infectious agents against which antibiotics are used. Besides leading to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), orally administered antibiotics are well known to cause dysbiosis. To counteract dysbiotic effects, numerous studies in the past two decades sought to understand whether probiotics are a valid tool to help re-establish a healthy gut microbial community after antibiotic treatment. However, although dysbiotic effects of antibiotics are well investigated, little is known about the effects of intramuscular antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiome and a few studies attempted to study treatment effects using phylogenetic diversity analysis techniques. In this study we sought to determine the effects of two probiotic- and one intramuscularly administered antibiotic treatment on the developing gut microbiome of post-weaning piglets between their 3rd and 9th week of life.

Methods Shotgun metagenomic sequences from over 800 faecal time-series samples derived from 126 piglets and 42 sows were analysed in a phylogenetic framework to characterise the developing gut microbial community composition of post-weaning piglets. We assessed the effects of intramuscular antibiotic treatment and probiotic oral treatment on the diversity of these gut microbial communities using alpha and beta diversity measures.

Results Differences between individual hosts such as breed, litter, and age, were found to be important contributors to variation in the community composition. Host age was the dominant factor in shaping the gut microbiota of piglets after weaning. The post-weaning pig gut microbiome appeared to follow a highly structured developmental program with characteristic post-weaning changes that can distinguish hosts that were born as little as two days apart in the second month of life. Treatment effects of the antibiotic and probiotic treatments were found but were subtle and included a higher representation of Mollicutes associated with intramuscular antibiotic treatment, and an increase of Lactobacillus associated with probiotic treatment.

Discussion The discovery of correlations between experimental factors and microbial community composition is more commonly addressed with OTU-based methods and rarely analysed via phylogenetic diversity measures. The latter method, although less intuitive than the former, suffers less from library size normalization biases, and it proved to be instrumental in this study for the discovery of correlations between microbiome composition and host-, and treatment factors.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Intensive farming practices can increase exposure of animals to infectious agents against which antibiotics are used.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background Intensive farming practices can increase exposure of animals to infectious agents against which antibiotics are used. Besides leading to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), orally administered antibiotics are well known to cause dysbiosis. To counteract dysbiotic effects, numerous studies in the past two decades sought to understand whether probiotics are a valid tool to help re-establish a healthy gut microbial community after antibiotic treatment. However, although dysbiotic effects of antibiotics are well investigated, little is known about the effects of intramuscular antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiome and a few studies attempted to study treatment effects using phylogenetic diversity analysis techniques. In this study we sought to determine the effects of two probiotic- and one intramuscularly administered antibiotic treatment on the developing gut microbiome of post-weaning piglets between their 3rd and 9th week of life.

Methods Shotgun metagenomic sequences from over 800 faecal time-series samples derived from 126 piglets and 42 sows were analysed in a phylogenetic framework to characterise the developing gut microbial community composition of post-weaning piglets. We assessed the effects of intramuscular antibiotic treatment and probiotic oral treatment on the diversity of these gut microbial communities using alpha and beta diversity measures.

Results Differences between individual hosts such as breed, litter, and age, were found to be important contributors to variation in the community composition. Host age was the dominant factor in shaping the gut microbiota of piglets after weaning. The post-weaning pig gut microbiome appeared to follow a highly structured developmental program with characteristic post-weaning changes that can distinguish hosts that were born as little as two days apart in the second month of life. Treatment effects of the antibiotic and probiotic treatments were found but were subtle and included a higher representation of Mollicutes associated with intramuscular antibiotic treatment, and an increase of Lactobacillus associated with probiotic treatment.

Discussion The discovery of correlations between experimental factors and microbial community composition is more commonly addressed with OTU-based methods and rarely analysed via phylogenetic diversity measures. The latter method, although less intuitive than the former, suffers less from library size normalization biases, and it proved to be instrumental in this study for the discovery of correlations between microbiome composition and host-, and treatment factors.

                              Intensive farming practices can increase exposure of animals to infectious agents against which antibiotics are used. Besides leading to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), orally administered antibiotics are well known to cause dysbiosis. To counteract dysbiotic effects, numerous studies in the past two decades sought to understand whether probiotics are a valid tool to help re-establish a healthy gut microbial community after antibiotic treatment. However, although dysbiotic effects of antibiotics are well investigated, little is known about the effects of intramuscular antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiome and a few studies attempted to study treatment effects using phylogenetic diversity analysis techniques. In this study we sought to determine the effects of two probiotic- and one intramuscularly administered antibiotic treatment on the developing gut microbiome of post-weaning piglets between their 3

                              Shotgun metagenomic sequences from over 800 faecal time-series samples derived from 126 piglets and 42 sows were analysed in a phylogenetic framework to characterise the developing gut microbial community composition of post-weaning piglets. We assessed the effects of intramuscular antibiotic treatment and probiotic oral treatment on the diversity of these gut microbial communities using alpha and beta diversity measures.

                              Differences between individual hosts such as breed, litter, and age, were found to be important contributors to variation in the community composition. Host age was the dominant factor in shaping the gut microbiota of piglets after weaning. The post-weaning pig gut microbiome appeared to follow a highly structured developmental program with characteristic post-weaning changes that can distinguish hosts that were born as little as two days apart in the second month of life. Treatment effects of the antibiotic and probiotic treatments were found but were subtle and included a higher representation of Mollicutes associated with intramuscular antibiotic treatment, and an increase of Lactobacillus associated with probiotic treatment.

                              The discovery of correlations between experimental factors and microbial community composition is more commonly addressed with OTU-based methods and rarely analysed via phylogenetic diversity measures. The latter method, although less intuitive than the former, suffers less from library size normalization biases, and it proved to be instrumental in this study for the discovery of correlations between microbiome composition and host-, and treatment factors.

                             As the world population grows, there is an accompanying demand for animal-derived products. Intensive animal husbandry and early weaning practices are commonly used to maximize production rates while minimizing costs. In a semi-natural environment, pig weaning occurs between the 12

                             following the administration of probiotic formulas. However, only in the past decade have advances in and higher accessibility to high-throughput sequencing techniques enabled researchers to better characterize microbial dynamics following probiotic treatment. Several of these studies used the amplification of the bacterial 16S rDNA V4 region, determining the effects of probiotics on the gut microbial community of swine

The choice of shotgun metagenomic sequencing over amplicon sequencing, in this study, was dictated by the use of this dataset outside of the scope described in this manuscript. In this study we assessed the effects of two probiotic formulas on the gut microbial community of post-weaning piglets undergoing a two-weeks probiotic treatment immediately after weaning. To assess the effects on the microbial community of the administration of probiotic following antibiotic treatment, two treatment groups were administered IM neomycin treatment followed by two weeks of either of the two probiotic formulae.

Firstly, we describe the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities, and secondly, the role of age, breed and litter in microbial community composition. Finally, we describe the temporal effects on microbial communities, and the associated effects of IM neomycin and probiotic treatments.

All surviving animals were euthanized at the end of the animal trial. Euthanasia occurred as follows: the piglets were restrained in dorsal recumbency in a bleeding cradle and pentobartitone euthanasia solution (Lethabarb, Virbac Australia, 325 mg pentobarbitone sodium/mL) diluted 1:1 in sterile normal saline was administered via the precava using a 20-21G needle depending on pig weight. The piglets received a dose of approximately 30 mg pentobarbitone/Kg to achieve deep anaesthesia, and then immediately exsanguinated. Exsanguination after a non-lethal dose of barbiturate was undertaken to reduce excessive congestion of the visceral blood vessels at the time of intestinal specimen collection (which is likely to occur if euthanasia is undertaken using an overdose of barbiturate alone).

                              All samples were included in the analysis, except for the analysis of treatment effect, where, in order to minimize the effect of age as a confounding factor, we excluded animals born on 2017-01-06 and on 2017-01-07. In this manner the largest age gap between animals was 3 days, with animals born on 2017-01-08 (n=24), 2017-01-09 (n=24), 2017-01-10 (n=23), and 2017-01-11 (n=39).

                              A randomized block design was adopted to mitigate batch effects. Because samples were distributed across ten 96-well plates during DNA extraction and library preparation, plate effects were expected. Although samples did not visibly cluster by DNA extraction plate across the first five principal components, a batch effect was found by multiple comparison analysis with ANOVA (alpha diversity: p range=0.0001-1; beta diversity: p value<0.0001) (

                              Beta diversity analysis of all samples revealed a distinct and consistent change of the microbial community over time in all piglets, regardless of the treatment.

                              Samples collected immediately after weaning (t0) were characterized by a higher representation of Bacteroidetes chlorobi group and Clostridia (PC1, 47.68%), particularly of Sedimibacterium and Desulfosporosinus (PC2 17.2%), respectively. Between day 0 (t0; immediately after weaning) and day 14 (t4), samples shifted towards a higher representation of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, as measured from beta diversity analysis (PC1; 47.68% var. explained) and from analysis of 16S rRNA reads (PC1 and PC2; 23.9% and 17.2% var. explained, respectively). During the last two weeks (t6-t10), corresponding to day 21 and 35 of post-weaning, samples shifted towards a higher representation of Actinobacteria, (PC2 21.79% var. explained), particularly of Collinsella (PC1 23.9%, PC2 17.2%).

We tested whether the treatments correlated with a change in phylogenetic diversity independently of the changes occurring with time. Given the differences in alpha and beta diversity detected among the subjects after weaning, we analyzed the deltas of phylogenetic diversity instead of relying on the absolute means, similar to the procedure applied by Kembel et al (2012)

Unrooted PD did not reach higher levels at later sampling time points. The highest BWPD accompanied by a high unrooted PD was reached after the second week post-weaning when piglets were aged between 4.9 and 5.6 weeks. Age-dependent physiological changes could explain i) the major shifts we detected in alpha diversity during the first two weeks after weaning and, ii) the distinct differences in community composition with age, even with a narrow age difference between piglets (1-5 days). We found a significant difference in microbial composition in both absolute diversity as in balance-weighted PD, only in the first week after weaning (piglets aged between 3.8 and 4.6 weeks), between groups of piglets that were separated by up to five days maximum by day of birth. Since age groups were confounded with breeds in our study, we attempted to determine the correlation within single cross-breeds. Unfortunately, although the correlations with age could still be detected, we could not determine the association at later time points due to the introduction of treatment effects.

However, individual variations such as breed and age are often unavoidable in large animal trials, especially involving animals derived from commercial herds. Previously reported confounding factors include: individual variation, cohabitation, age, maternal effects, hormones, behavioural differences between breeds (e.g. coprophagy, mouth to mouth contact) and extent of long-term behavioural adaptation, which can differ between breeds for reasons not attributable to genetics

A litter effect was found in piglets at the start of the trial (piglets aged between 3.8 and 4.6 weeks; samples collected immediately after weaning) and was lost at later time points during the trial. This could be due to either of the aforementioned factors. Co-housing, aging and the splitting of the piglets in separate rooms to receive a different treatment, are possible causes for loss of the litter effect. In this study we confirm the importance of these factors in the contribution to inter-individual variability of gut microbial composition.

Samples also clustered by age groups in beta diversity four weeks after weaning. The groups we tested, based on age, cross-breed, and litter, differed in sample sizes, therefore a non-parametric test was used to test for associations of host factors with phylogenetic diversity. Based on our results we conclude that even small age differences among post-weaning piglets, down to the day, must be accounted for in an experimental set up, but we acknowledge that the method we used may have less power to detect small effects than methods which make assumptions of balance in group sizes.

                             . The effects of intramuscular administration of neomycin (aminoglycoside class) on the gut microbiota have to our knowledge not been investigated. Based on our results we conclude that a mild effect on phylogenetic diversity is appreciable post IM neomycin treatment, up to two weeks after termination of the treatment. Additional compositional and functional analysis is necessary to determine the source of this mild variation. Differences were not detected at later time points, based on our phylogenetic diversity analyses, suggesting a full recovery of the microbial communities after two weeks from the end of the treatment.

                             It is possible that the large shifts in phylogenetic diversity taking place in the first two weeks irrespective of the treatment (an increase, then decrease of unrooted PD, and an opposite trend of BWPD) have masked the milder effects of the treatment, despite our efforts to control for the effects of aging. This could be the reason why a significantly distinct alpha diversity trend was found in the neomycin+D-Scour™ cohort compared to the neomycin cohort, but not in the D-Scour™ cohort compared to the Control cohort. There are multiple studies reporting beneficial effects of probiotic treatment in sucker and weaner piglets in terms of improved gut mucosal integrity

Additionally, the ColiGuard® treatment correlated with a lower weight gain, whether or not it was preceded by the antibiotic treatment. However, when comparing the overall weight gain (from the start to the end of the trial, corresponding to the six weeks after weaning) the weight gain in the cohorts receiving ColiGuard® did not differ from the other cohorts.

                             , we wanted to test to what extent the use of a larger sampling size would affect the diversity obtained from these samples. A 100K downsampling size corresponds to a 0.6% of reads of an average sample. Increasing the sampling size from 0.6% to 6%, affected BWPD only slightly, while it increased the unrooted PD and decreased its variance. As expected, a larger sampling size enriches the absolute diversity by increasing the chance to make new read placements, and it lessens the variance in estimates, but it does not affect the core microbiome. However, the small difference between sampling sizes could 1. demonstrate how powerful the method is in describing diversity using a small sampling size, or 2. reflect the limits imposed by the phylogenetic markers database, as it was pointed out by Darling et al (2014)

                             Our findings stress the importance of confounding factors such as breed, age and maternal effects when assessing the effect of treatment on the gut microbiome. We found that age, even within a narrow age span (1-5 days) can have an impact on microbial shifts and should be accounted for in microbiome studies, either (i). by accounting for it as a confounding variable in the hypothesis-testing model used, or (ii). by avoiding, where possible, the inclusion of subjects of different ages, or (iii). by allowing a sufficiently long period of time prior to the start of the treatment. The latter allows animals to become accustomed to the new environment and researchers to perform additional sampling. Allowing animals a sufficiently long period of time to become accustomed to the new environment (e.g.: temperature, humidity, new microbes, etc) is meant to reduce noise derived from external factors, while repeated sampling, likewise, aims to increase the confidence in the signal prior to treatment.

The revised manuscript describes the phylogenetic diversity analysis framework and results.
One author has been been removed in the revised manuscript.
Phylogenetic diversity analysis has been recomputed using a different downsampling depth (1 million reads reads per same instead of 100,000) therefore results, including figures and supplementary figures have been updated. The effect of distinct downsampling depths has been measured and described in the revised manuscript.
Several figures and supplementary figures have been merged and the total number of figures reduced to improve clarity. Sampling methods, and probiotic and antibiotic treatments have been described better. The manuscript has been considerably restructured around a main thread and the goals are better outlined. Additional literature describing the temporal microbial dynamics has been cited.
