While many national registries, health facilities, and research groups are collecting relevant data, we need a collaborative and methodologically rigorous approach to better combine these data and address knowledge gaps, especially those related to rare outcomes. We propose that using a sequential, prospective meta-analysis (PMA) is the best approach to generate data for policy- and practice-oriented guidelines. As the pandemic evolves, additional studies identified retrospectively by the steering committee or through living systematic reviews will be invited to participate in this PMA. Investigators can contribute to the PMA by either submitting individual patient data or running standardized code to generate aggregate data estimates. For the primary analysis, we will pool data using two-stage meta-analysis methods. The meta-analyses will be updated as additional data accrue in each contributing study and as additional studies meet study-specific time or data accrual thresholds for sharing. At the time of publication, investigators of 25 studies, including more than 76,000 pregnancies, in 41 countries had agreed to share data for this analysis. Among the included studies, 12 have a contemporaneous comparison group of pregnancies without COVID-19, and four studies include a comparison group of non-pregnant women of reproductive age with COVID-19. Protocols and updates will be maintained publicly. Results will be shared with key stakeholders, including the World Health Organization (WHO) Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health (MNCAH) Research Working Group. Data contributors will share results with local stakeholders. Scientific publications will be published in open-access journals on an ongoing basis.

### Author Declarations

I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

Yes

The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:

This is a protocol paper and thus exempt from ethical approval. Ultimately, the meta-analysis study is exempt from human research ethics approval as the study authors will be synthesizing de-identified or aggregate data.

I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.

Yes

I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).

Yes

I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.

Yes

This is a protocol paper and there is no related data to share."/>

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="We urgently need answers to basic epidemiological questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant and postpartum women and its effect on their newborns. While many national registries, health facilities, and research groups are collecting relevant data, we need a collaborative and methodologically rigorous approach to better combine these data and address knowledge gaps, especially those related to rare outcomes. We propose that using a sequential, prospective meta-analysis (PMA) is the best approach to generate data for policy- and practice-oriented guidelines. As the pandemic evolves, additional studies identified retrospectively by the steering committee or through living systematic reviews will be invited to participate in this PMA. Investigators can contribute to the PMA by either submitting individual patient data or running standardized code to generate aggregate data estimates. For the primary analysis, we will pool data using two-stage meta-analysis methods. The meta-analyses will be updated as additional data accrue in each contributing study and as additional studies meet study-specific time or data accrual thresholds for sharing. At the time of publication, investigators of 25 studies, including more than 76,000 pregnancies, in 41 countries had agreed to share data for this analysis. Among the included studies, 12 have a contemporaneous comparison group of pregnancies without COVID-19, and four studies include a comparison group of non-pregnant women of reproductive age with COVID-19. Protocols and updates will be maintained publicly. Results will be shared with key stakeholders, including the World Health Organization (WHO) Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health (MNCAH) Research Working Group. Data contributors will share results with local stakeholders. Scientific publications will be published in open-access journals on an ongoing basis.

### Clinical Trial

PROSPERO ID: 188955

### Funding Statement

Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant to Emily Smith (INV-022057) at George Washington University and a grant to Emily Smith via a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to Stephanie Gaw (INV-017035) at University of California San Francisco.

### Author Declarations

I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

Yes

The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:

This is a protocol paper and thus exempt from ethical approval. Ultimately, the meta-analysis study is exempt from human research ethics approval as the study authors will be synthesizing de-identified or aggregate data.

I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.

Yes

I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).

Yes

I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.

Yes

This is a protocol paper and there is no related data to share."/>

                             We urgently need answers to basic epidemiological questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant and postpartum women and its effect on their newborns. While many national registries, health facilities, and research groups are collecting relevant data, we need a collaborative and methodologically rigorous approach to better combine these data and address knowledge gaps, especially those related to rare outcomes. We propose that using a sequential, prospective meta-analysis (PMA) is the best approach to generate data for policy- and practice-oriented guidelines. As the pandemic evolves, additional studies identified retrospectively by the steering committee or through living systematic reviews will be invited to participate in this PMA. Investigators can contribute to the PMA by either submitting individual patient data or running standardized code to generate aggregate data estimates. For the primary analysis, we will pool data using two-stage meta-analysis methods. The meta-analyses will be updated as additional data accrue in each contributing study and as additional studies meet study-specific time or data accrual thresholds for sharing. At the time of publication, investigators of 25 studies, including more than 76,000 pregnancies, in 41 countries had agreed to share data for this analysis. Among the included studies, 12 have a contemporaneous comparison group of pregnancies without COVID-19, and four studies include a comparison group of non-pregnant women of reproductive age with COVID-19. Protocols and updates will be maintained publicly. Results will be shared with key stakeholders, including the World Health Organization (WHO) Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health (MNCAH) Research Working Group. Data contributors will share results with local stakeholders. Scientific publications will be published in open-access journals on an ongoing basis.

                             ]. The specific mechanisms for this increased risk are unknown, though may be related to physiologic and immunologic changes during pregnancy. Pregnant women are generally at increased risk for severe illness from many infectious diseases including influenza, hepatitis E, malaria, and herpes simplex virus [

                             Pregnant women with COVID-19, and their offspring, may be at increased risk for complications due to severe illness and adverse pregnancy outcomes. A living systematic review suggests that pregnant women with COVID-19, compared to non-pregnant women with COVID-19, are more than twice as likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) or require invasive ventilation [

In an observational cohort study of 1,219 pregnant women across 33 U.S. hospitals with positive SARS-CoV-2 test (molecular or antigen) at the time of delivery, severe or critical COVID-19 was associated with a 40% increase in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and a 42% increase in preterm birth, as compared to asymptomatic pregnant patients [

A pooled analysis of 41 studies including 3323 pregnant women with COVID-19 found that one-third of their newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU); a meta-analysis of ten studies found that newborns born to pregnant women with COVID-19 were nearly five times more likely to be admitted to the NICU as compared to COVID-19 negative pregnancies [

                             Despite the urgent need to accurately document the number of cases, severe illness, and deaths in pregnant women, available data on maternal and infant complications related to COVID-19 remain heterogenous [

The high degree of heterogeneity in study designs, comparison groups, and definitions of key health outcomes across studies makes it difficult to clearly understand any excess risks and guide policy for pregnant and postpartum women and their newborns. For example, the current (February 2021) living systematic review on COVID-19 in pregnancy included 192 studies with 64,676 pregnant and postpartum patients; the heterogeneity in published outcomes meant that only a small fraction of those studies could be combined for key analyses, and data from some regions of the world, (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa) were absent. For example, data were available from only a handful of studies to examine a few risk factors for a single outcome (severe COVID and death), and there were fewer than 10 studies that compared the risk of maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes between pregnant and postpartum patients versus either pregnant patients without COVID-19 or nonpregnant women of reproductive age with COVID-19 [

                             ]. Further, we have limited data on the efficacy of treatments and preventives in pregnancy and postpartum, due largely to the systematic exclusions of pregnant people from the relevant clinical trials until recently. The same was true of the seminal vaccine trials, although vaccine studies among pregnant women began in early 2021 (

                             COVID-19 data in pregnancy and infancy was scarce at first, and now it is heterogeneous. These shortcomings exist in part because data collection protocols have differed, and the underlying population risks for severe illnesses vary globally. It is therefore necessary to generate high-quality information with a unified data harmonization plan and analytic strategy. This approach will permit us to make evidence-driven decisions and to create guidelines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in pregnant women. Because little of the existing data can be pooled, our ability to make strong recommendations related to COVID-19’s risks in pregnancy and the postpartum period is limited. We are similarly constrained in our capacity to offer guidance as to the potential benefits of new interventions, like vaccines. So we propose to fill this gap by conducting a sequential prospective meta-analysis (PMA). This PMA will be a robust, collaborative, global approach to accrue harmonized data, with the objective of generating policy and practice-relevant data about the epidemiology of COVID-19 in the pregnancy and postnatal periods.

We will choose a single study to contribute cases from given locations (e.g. health facilities, cities, states, or countries). The study with the most complete data will be selected to contribute, or in the case of similar data between studies, we will include data from the study that was the first to join the PMA. The number of studies and the number of cases per study is therefore likely to change with each updated meta-analysis, given this robust analytical strategy.

                              ]. As data accumulate, we will evaluate the robustness of the inferences and whether the answer can be reasonably inferred via a conservative sample size. Assuming at least 50% heterogeneity between sites, the need for 90% power and 5% type 1 error to detect a difference, a conservative 1% prevalence/incidence and a risk ratio of 1.5 for the considered subgroup, a minimum of 30,000 participants are required to demonstrate an effect for each outcome and the proposed subgroups (risk factors). Alternatively, a total of 400 events or more may be used as a threshold for ‘sufficient evidence’ in accordance with recommendation of the GRADEPROfiler [

                             Our sequential, prospective meta-analysis aims to pool individual patient data from ongoing or completed studies, registries, and surveillance programs that identify SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnancy and postpartum.

                             There are several benefits to our approach, which is guided by the principles of flexibility, robustness, collaboration, and inclusion. Early efforts to plan for pooling can reduce research waste (e.g., incompatible data, duplication of efforts) and improve the collective value of data [
                             <a id="xref-ref-33-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-33">

                             ]. Through collaboration since April 2020, including participation in WHO-coordinated working groups, we have developed and shared data collection tools and standardized some data collection components while several participating studies were starting their respective research. Ongoing pooling has also highlighted where data elements are missing or sparse across studies, thus providing justification for additional effort from study investigators to retrospectively extract additional data or modify their data collection forms. Further, this collaborative approach of pooling data highlights the possibility of generating robust answers to questions of collective importance at a global scale [

                             ]. We are also more likely to elucidate risks related to rare outcomes. Collaboration is especially important for achieving scientific consensus regarding special populations—such as pregnant patients and newborns—who may not be specifically considered in national surveillance programs and may be actively excluded from other clinical research.
                            </p>

                             Our approach uses statistical methods for individual patient data meta-analysis, which is generally considered to be the gold standard in pooling data given the many steps used to ensure quality and consistency of the data and analyses. All data will be reviewed with the same data quality assessments, and outliers will be assessed consistently across studies. Analysis definitions will be standardized across studies. This is especially important given that for many outcomes, study definitions vary between countries (e.g. whether a woman should receive critical care, the gestational age cutoff for defining stillbirth). Furthermore, we will avoid duplicate case counting by working with and reanalyzing data from studies that include overlapping health facilities and centers that contribute to two or more studies. This has been a major issue in COVID-19-related meta-analyses because much scientific literature is based on case reports or case series; the same cases sometimes appear in multiple published papers. Traditional meta-analyses based on the published literature cannot resolve these methodological issues.
                            </p>

                             Importantly, this approach is robust, flexible and collaborative. Each set of investigators can implement their own protocol, offering more flexibility to design a study specific to a given setting. Investigators can also proceed with their own study publications, thus ensuring an opportunity to be explicit about the local context in which the data collection took place and clearly take the credit associated with authorship. Our basic analyses will be done as a two-stage meta-analysis, allowing us flexibility in how data is shared. Studies that are willing and able can share their individual patient data directly with the data coordinating team for central analysis. Alternatively, studies that are unwilling or unable to share individual patient data can appoint their own study-specific data analyst to join the PMA data coordinating team. This approach to a “distributed” individual patient data meta-analysis meets data sharing needs for different groups, and hopefully ensures that anyone can participate. Finally, our regular steering committee meeting allows for joint decision-making about which analyses should be prioritized and when to move forward with publications. We hope to be responsive to emerging, policy-relevant questions, such as the safety and efficacy of vaccination in pregnancy.

In the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is limited high-quality data that can be pooled in order to inform public health guidance and healthcare strategies, specifically for pregnant women and their newborns. The proposed study will contribute necessary information for evidence-based decision-making related to COVID-19 and maternal and neonatal health.
