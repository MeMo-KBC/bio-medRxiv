                             A consensus methodology for pharmacometric assessment of candidate SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs would be useful for comparing trial results and improving trial design. The time to viral clearance, assessed by serial qPCR of nasopharyngeal swab samples, has been the most widely reported measure of virological response in clinical trials, but it has not been compared formally with other metrics, notably model-based estimates of the rate of viral clearance. We analysed prospectively gathered viral clearance profiles from 280 infection episodes in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. We fitted different phenomenological pharmacodynamic models (single exponential decay, bi-exponential, penalised splines) and found that the clearance rate, estimated from a mixed effects single exponential decay model, is a robust pharmacodynamic summary of viral clearance. The rate of viral clearance, estimated from viral densities during the first week following peak viral load, provides increased statistical power (reduced type 2 error) compared with time to clearance. We recommend that pharmacometric antiviral assessments should be conducted in early illness with serial qPCR samples taken over one week.

                             Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection can be characterised approximately as two overlapping clinical stages. The first pre-symptomatic stage comprises uncontrolled viral replication. Peak viral loads in the nasopharynx or oropharynx of individuals with symptomatic COVID-19 illness occur around the time of symptom onset [

                             ]. The second stage of infection comprises a first order decrease in the viral load resulting from activation of host-defence mechanisms. Viral multiplication is attenuated, and clearance is augmented by effective host defences [

                             ]. During this second stage a small subset of infected individuals (<5%) progress to severe pneumonia and some will die. The risk is strongly age dependent [

                             ]. Effective antiviral medicines administered early during SARS-CoV-2 infections should reduce the overall viral load, accelerate virus clearance, and reduce the probability of progression to severe COVID-19 illness. This has been shown most convincingly for the monoclonal antibody mixture of casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-CoV-2) [

                             ]. Large sample sizes are required to detect meaningful effects in outpatient studies, even if high risk subgroups only are enrolled, as only a minority of symptomatic individuals develop hypoxaemia and progress to require hospitalisation [

                             ]. In vaccinated populations progression to severe disease is now unusual. How then can the long list of repurposed candidate antivirals be prioritised for phase 3 evaluation, and how can the expanding number of candidate new antivirals be compared? Accurate measurement of viral clearance is potentially the most efficient method of ‘phase 2’ candidate drug screening and dose-finding, but there is currently no consensus on the pharmacometric methodology.

                             In the first week after becoming symptomatic with COVID-19, viral concentrations in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples decline exponentially [

                             ]. It is increasingly evident that the pattern of viral elimination is often bi-exponential, although the second phase, which is close to the limit of accurate viral quantitation, may be unobserved if follow-up is not extended. In the context of a clinical trial viral clearance can be summarised in many different ways. The most commonly employed is time-to-clearance (the time to reach the lower limit of detection for a given assay) [
                             <a id="xref-ref-11-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">

                             ] but this is dependent on both the assay used and the baseline viral load (i.e. the viral load at enrolment in the study, which will depend on how cases are ascertained and the individual peak viral loads which vary substantially across individuals). We used prospectively gathered data from 280 infection episodes from individuals who had frequent qPCR sampling before and after peak viral load to characterise the kinetics of viral clearance and to propose robust summary statistics as pharmacodynamic endpoints for pharmacometric evaluations and phase 2 type clinical trials.

For each clinical trial simulation we drew a single sample from the posterior distribution of model 2, generated random effect terms for each individual in the trial, and then generated simulated CT data. We assumed that the clinical trial was comparing no intervention to an antiviral agent whose effect size γ was parameterised on the log scale as a constant scaling factor on the population mean rate coefficients α and β. We simulated trials that did twice daily swabs (performed independently) over either 7 or 5 days (a total of 16 or 12 viral load estimates). For each simulated dataset we then estimated the treatment effect by fitting the single exponential model (thus mis-specified by design). The treatment effect

                              After data pre-processing we had serial viral load data in 280 infection episodes after the inferred peak viral load with a median of 7 samples per infection (

We fitted three phenomenological models to these post-peak clearance data: a single rate exponential decay Bayesian hierarchical model; a bi-exponential decay Bayesian hierarchical model; and a random effects additive linear model (penalised spline regression). All three models showed substantial bias in the distribution of the residuals as a function of the observed CT values, with the strongest bias appearing for the single exponential decay model. As the overall profile of viral clearance is clearly non-linear on the CT scale (as demonstrated by the daily median CT values shown by the pink triangles in

                              , note that the median is unbiased with left censoring), the linear model gives a compromise fit with a lower intercept and shallower slope. The bi-exponential decay model also had a biased residual distribution but the fit was substantially better for some infections which clearly demonstrated a second phase (see individual fits in

                              The virological endpoint most commonly used in COVID-19 clinical trials is the time to viral clearance (a model-free measure, although the exact definition of this measure varies across trials). Time to clearance as a summary statistic is ‘inefficient’ because it is dependent on the initial viral load; it does not borrow information across time points; and it only uses the noisy estimate of when the viral load first reaches the lower limit of detection. It is also influenced by the variable presence of the second slower phase of viral clearance. There was no difference between time to clearance in the vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals (

                              Previous work has estimated that sample sizes of approximately 500 patients per arm are required for clinical trials evaluating differences in time to viral clearance as primary end-points [

                              ]. We postulated that by estimating the rate of clearance directly from daily serial viral load measurements, necessary sample sizes could be reduced substantially. By estimating the rate of clearance (even under a mis-specified model) information is borrowed across the serial viral load measurements, thereby resulting in a gain in efficiency relative to the standard approach of estimating the time to clearance. To explore this, we simulated data under the posterior predictive distribution of model 2 (bi-exponential decay) fitted to the NBA dataset. We assumed effect sizes equal to 30% and 50% increases in the population clearance rate parameters of the model. This results in approximately a median 3-4 cycle threshold difference by day 5.

                             An effective, well tolerated, safe, affordable and generally available treatment of COVID-19 that prevented progression to severe disease would be of enormous global health benefit. There have been many small clinical trials assessing the efficacy of repurposed candidate antivirals, justified usually by moderate inhibitory activity in virus cell cultures, but actionable evidence has come mainly from relatively few large randomised controlled trials in hospitalized patients. However, by the time patients require hospital care, viral loads have declined and immune pathology dominates the clinical picture. In these large RCTs immunomodulators (notably corticosteroids and IL-6 antagonists) have proved life-saving [

                             ]. These RCTs in hospitalised patients have not shown life-saving benefit from any of the antiviral repurposing candidates. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, developed originally to treat hepatitis C, was associated with a shorter duration of hospitalisation in a randomised controlled trial [

                             Recently large RCTs in outpatients with uncomplicated COVID-19, mainly comprising “high risk” individuals (i.e older and with co-morbidities predisposing to more severe illness), have shown significant clinical benefits with both SARS-CoV-2 directed monoclonal antibodies [

Apart from these three, there are a large number of both repurposed and novel antiviral drugs either in development or under consideration for COVID-19 prophylaxis or treatment, but there is no agreed methodology for testing them in vivo or for determining the optimum dosage. It is simply not possible to conduct very large RCTs on each potential antiviral treatment, so a method of in-vivo pharmacometric assessment is needed in order to choose potential candidates for larger “phase 3” evaluations, to compare new antiviral therapies, and to optimise dosing. Although COVID-19 is a systemic infection, viral clearance from the upper respiratory tract is the only readily accessible measure of an ambulant patient’s virological response. Viral densities in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples peak around the time of clinical presentation and then exhibit a bi-exponential decline within the first week of illness. Previous vaccination or infection accelerates viral clearance [

                             Our analyses suggest that viral clearance is best assessed by measuring the approximate slope of the log-linear decline in qPCR densities (ΔCT values, accounting for left-censoring) over the first week after starting treatment. In many patients a bi-phasic elimination profile is evident, but the majority of viral load reduction is in the initial phase, and it is this phase which is accelerated by effective interventions (vaccination, monoclonal antibodies, small molecule antivirals). Although mis-specified, the log-linear model appears to capture in a robust way the overall trend of viral clearance. The widely reported time to viral clearance is a less precise measure, and it results in lower statistical power in pharmacometric studies. This is because the time to viral clearance depends on the frequency of testing, the sensitivity and reproducibility of the method and, critically, the initial virus density (and thus the stage of disease). It is also variably confounded by detection of the slower terminal virus elimination phase.

                             Viral clearance reflects both host-defence and any additional contribution from an antiviral therapeutic. Thus, the pattern of clearance will depend on the stage of disease and the host’s response. We propose using the slope of the initial log-linear decline in viral densities in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal secretions (i.e., the rate constant of the major decline) as the primary endpoint in phase 2 studies. The difference between the slopes with the putative antiviral and without represents the drug effect. Evaluations of therapeutic interventions which do not report these values and use time to viral clearance as the primary endpoint are difficult to interpret. Time-to-clearance results in a higher type 2 error (lower power) than rate-of-clearance, and therefore requires larger sample sizes, at least daily sampling, and longer duration of follow-up. It is therefore imprecise, inefficient, and consequently expensive. Importantly, any comparison or metaanalysis of studies which used different sampling techniques, or had different qPCR sensitivities, or different cut-offs, is confounded systematically if time-to-clearance is used as an endpoint, but not if rate-of-clearance is measured. It is important to note that comparisons between interventions should be contemporary as both immune status and viral variants are important contributors to viral clearance. Observational studies using historical controls would likely give misleading results.

                             There are several limitations to this study. The data were obtained from a monitoring scheme and not a prospective study of antiviral pharmacodynamics. The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved rapidly with an increasing proportion of the population being immunised and rapid changes in viral variants. More information on viral dynamics in infections with the Omicron variant in vaccinated individuals is needed. The rate constant of the decline in viral densities over one week is a hybrid parameter and more information is needed on virus clearance profiles in different settings to determine if this is the optimum pharmacodynamic measure in all circumstances. There is substantial variation in measured viral densities, even within an individual infection, and more information on the sources of variance is needed to refine these approaches.

                             In summary our model-based simulations suggest that pharmacometric assessment of candidate antivirals for COVID-19 should measure virus clearance rate, and not the much more widely used time to clearance, as their primary endpoint. If performed in early uncomplicated illness, reasonable precision can be obtained with twice daily qPCR samples taken over the course of one week after enrolment in each studied patient. Adaptive randomisation using the viral clearance rate can rapidly identify active intervention arms.
