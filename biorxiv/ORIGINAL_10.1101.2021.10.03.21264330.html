  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Higher-resolution tumor-agnostic biomarkers that predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy are needed. Mutation signatures reflect underlying oncogenic processes that can affect tumor immunogenicity, and thus potentially delineate ICI treatment response among tumor types. Systematic mutational signature analysis on all solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas yielded eight distinct tumor genomic subtypes, which were characterized by smoking exposure, ultraviolet light exposure, APOBEC enzyme activity, POLE mutation, mismatch repair deficiency, homologous recombination deficiency, genomic stability, and aging. The former five subtypes were construed to form an immune-responsive group acting as candidates for ICI therapy because of their high expression of immune-related genes and enrichment in cancer types with FDA approval for ICI monotherapy. Under this hypothesis, we developed a software to classify new tumors submitted to whole-exome sequencing. A pan-cancer dataset containing 973 cases treated with ICIs and clinical response was used for validation, where the classified tumor subtypes were significantly associated with ICI response, independent of cancer type and tumor mutational burden high or low status. The new tumor subtyping method can serve as a tumor-agnostic biomarker for ICI response prediction and will improve decision making in cancer treatment.

Background In cancer therapy, higher-resolution tumor-agnostic biomarkers that predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy are needed. Mutation signatures reflect underlying oncogenic processes that can affect tumor immunogenicity, and thus potentially delineate ICI treatment response among tumor types.

Methods Based on mutational signature analysis, we developed a stratification for all solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Subsequently, we developed a new software (GS-PRACTICE) to classify new tumors submitted to whole-exome sequencing. Using existing data from 973 pan-cancer ICI-treated cases with outcomes, we evaluated the subtype-response predictive performance.

Results Systematic analysis on TCGA samples identified eight tumor genomic subtypes, which were characterized by features represented by smoking exposure, ultraviolet light exposure, APOBEC enzyme activity, POLE mutation, mismatch repair deficiency, homologous recombination deficiency, genomic stability, and aging. The former five subtypes were presumed to form an immune-responsive group acting as candidates for ICI therapy because of their high expression of immune-related genes and enrichment in cancer types with FDA approval for ICI monotherapy. In the validation cohort, the samples assigned by GS-PRACTICE to the immune-reactive subtypes were significantly associated with ICI response independent of cancer type and TMB high or low status.

Conclusions The new tumor subtyping method can serve as a tumor-agnostic biomarker for ICI response prediction and will improve decision making in cancer treatment.

One Sentence Summary A novel tumor genome subtyping method based on mutation signature analysis can predict response to immune checkpoint therapy orthogonally to tumor mutational burden.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Higher-resolution tumor-agnostic biomarkers that predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy are needed. Mutation signatures reflect underlying oncogenic processes that can affect tumor immunogenicity, and thus potentially delineate ICI treatment response among tumor types. Systematic mutational signature analysis on all solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas yielded eight distinct tumor genomic subtypes, which were characterized by smoking exposure, ultraviolet light exposure, APOBEC enzyme activity, POLE mutation, mismatch repair deficiency, homologous recombination deficiency, genomic stability, and aging. The former five subtypes were construed to form an immune-responsive group acting as candidates for ICI therapy because of their high expression of immune-related genes and enrichment in cancer types with FDA approval for ICI monotherapy. Under this hypothesis, we developed a software to classify new tumors submitted to whole-exome sequencing. A pan-cancer dataset containing 973 cases treated with ICIs and clinical response was used for validation, where the classified tumor subtypes were significantly associated with ICI response, independent of cancer type and tumor mutational burden high or low status. The new tumor subtyping method can serve as a tumor-agnostic biomarker for ICI response prediction and will improve decision making in cancer treatment.

Background In cancer therapy, higher-resolution tumor-agnostic biomarkers that predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy are needed. Mutation signatures reflect underlying oncogenic processes that can affect tumor immunogenicity, and thus potentially delineate ICI treatment response among tumor types.

Methods Based on mutational signature analysis, we developed a stratification for all solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Subsequently, we developed a new software (GS-PRACTICE) to classify new tumors submitted to whole-exome sequencing. Using existing data from 973 pan-cancer ICI-treated cases with outcomes, we evaluated the subtype-response predictive performance.

Results Systematic analysis on TCGA samples identified eight tumor genomic subtypes, which were characterized by features represented by smoking exposure, ultraviolet light exposure, APOBEC enzyme activity, POLE mutation, mismatch repair deficiency, homologous recombination deficiency, genomic stability, and aging. The former five subtypes were presumed to form an immune-responsive group acting as candidates for ICI therapy because of their high expression of immune-related genes and enrichment in cancer types with FDA approval for ICI monotherapy. In the validation cohort, the samples assigned by GS-PRACTICE to the immune-reactive subtypes were significantly associated with ICI response independent of cancer type and TMB high or low status.

Conclusions The new tumor subtyping method can serve as a tumor-agnostic biomarker for ICI response prediction and will improve decision making in cancer treatment.

One Sentence Summary A novel tumor genome subtyping method based on mutation signature analysis can predict response to immune checkpoint therapy orthogonally to tumor mutational burden.

                             Higher-resolution tumor-agnostic biomarkers that predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy are needed. Mutation signatures reflect underlying oncogenic processes that can affect tumor immunogenicity, and thus potentially delineate ICI treatment response among tumor types. Systematic mutational signature analysis on all solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas yielded eight distinct tumor genomic subtypes, which were characterized by smoking exposure, ultraviolet light exposure, APOBEC enzyme activity, POLE mutation, mismatch repair deficiency, homologous recombination deficiency, genomic stability, and aging. The former five subtypes were construed to form an immune-responsive group acting as candidates for ICI therapy because of their high expression of immune-related genes and enrichment in cancer types with FDA approval for ICI monotherapy. Under this hypothesis, we developed a software to classify new tumors submitted to whole-exome sequencing. A pan-cancer dataset containing 973 cases treated with ICIs and clinical response was used for validation, where the classified tumor subtypes were significantly associated with ICI response, independent of cancer type and tumor mutational burden high or low status. The new tumor subtyping method can serve as a tumor-agnostic biomarker for ICI response prediction and will improve decision making in cancer treatment.

                               In cancer therapy, higher-resolution tumor-agnostic biomarkers that predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy are needed. Mutation signatures reflect underlying oncogenic processes that can affect tumor immunogenicity, and thus potentially delineate ICI treatment response among tumor types.

                               Based on mutational signature analysis, we developed a stratification for all solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Subsequently, we developed a new software (GS-PRACTICE) to classify new tumors submitted to whole-exome sequencing. Using existing data from 973 pan-cancer ICI-treated cases with outcomes, we evaluated the subtype-response predictive performance.

                               Systematic analysis on TCGA samples identified eight tumor genomic subtypes, which were characterized by features represented by smoking exposure, ultraviolet light exposure, APOBEC enzyme activity, POLE mutation, mismatch repair deficiency, homologous recombination deficiency, genomic stability, and aging. The former five subtypes were presumed to form an immune-responsive group acting as candidates for ICI therapy because of their high expression of immune-related genes and enrichment in cancer types with FDA approval for ICI monotherapy. In the validation cohort, the samples assigned by GS-PRACTICE to the immune-reactive subtypes were significantly associated with ICI response independent of cancer type and TMB high or low status.

                             The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has provided substantial opportunities in cancer treatment. However, the proportion of patients who benefit from ICIs varies widely by cancer type

A recently established predictive biomarker is the loss of mismatch repair protein in immunohistochemistry or microsatellite instability (MSI-high), which indicates mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) status

High concurrence with analyses based on Mutect2 was observed (Figure S9A, S9B). To extract samples typical for each subtype as a training dataset, samples with matching classification results in at least three of the four methods, including concomitant classification with Mutect2, were selected and used for subsequent analysis (Figure S9B, S9C). The resulting 7181 samples and their 30 COSMIC signature scores were used as features to construct Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression classifiers with optimized hyperparameters (see Methods and Figure S10A). All classifiers showed more than 95% subset accuracy (exact match ratio) in multi-label classification (Figure S10B), yielding a robust 8-class ensemble-based stratification tool.

The classifier concordance rate was also consistent across different data sources, and was consistent irrespective of whether samples were of FFPE or frozen tissue origin (Figure S10C). Re-analyses restricted to individual cancer types yielded identical conclusions with respect to tissue origin and source (

In other words, our method may add biological rationales to the empirically determined TMB cutoff.Additionally, the previous report that the optimal cutoffs for TMB-high differed among cancer types

                             While GS-PRACTICE represents an advance in cancer diagnostics and clinical decision making, some limitations of this work must be made transparent. First, due to lack of data, prolonged survival or improved quality of life in ICI-responsible irGS patients could be quantitatively validated. For this purpose, design and logistics of appropriate randomized control trials using ICI are needed. Secondly, accurate subtyping may not be possible for tumors with a small number of mutations due to computational reasons. The clustering results using the four variant callers showed relatively low concordance rates for the HRD, AGE, and GNS subtypes (Figure S9B). Renal cancers had a moderately low number of mutations and were mostly classified as HRD, but their HRD scores and indel signature 6 ratios were low (Figure S7B), indicating that they are unlikely to have homologous recombination deficiency properties. It is known that the response to ICI in renal cancer is not associated with TMB

                             GS-PRACTICE represents a pan-cancer advancement in both solid tumor diagnostics and precision medicine, as it subtypes tumors by leveraging mutational signatures with defined etiologies, and the subtypes were shown to be indicative of ICI response. The method can be reproducibly applied to WES data derived from FFPE specimens, and thus immediately provide a predictive biomarker for ICI treatment in clinical practice. Future analyses of randomized control trials and whole genome sequencing will spur improved dataset generation for model building, which will subsequently strengthen the clinical utility of the protocol developed herein.
