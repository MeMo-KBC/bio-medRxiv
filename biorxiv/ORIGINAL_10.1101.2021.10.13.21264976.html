                             The recent increase in the number of molecular-targeted agents for non-small cell lung carcinoma and the corresponding target genes has led to the demand for the simultaneous testing of multiple genes. Although gene panels that use next-generation sequencing (NGS) are ideal for this purpose, conventional panels require a high tumor content, and biopsy samples often do not meet this requirement. We developed a new NGS panel, called a compact panel, to accommodate biopsy samples without restricting tumor content. The panel was characterized by high sensitivity, with detection limits for mutations of 0.14%, 0.20%, 0.48%, 0.24%, and 0.20% for EGFR exon 19 deletion, L858R, T790M, BRAF V600E, and KRAS G12C, respectively. Mutation detection also had a high quantitative ability, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.966 to 0.992. The threshold for fusion detection was 1%. The panel exhibited good concordance with the approved tests. Identity rates are as follows: EGFR positive, 100% (95% confidence interval, 95.5-100); EGFR negative, 90.9 (82.2-96.3); BRAF positive, 100 (59.0-100); BRAF negative, 100 (94.9-100); KRAS G12C positive, 100 (92.7-100); KRAS G12C negative, 100 (93.0-100); ALK positive, 96.7 (83.8-99.9); ALK negative, 98.4 (97.2-99.2); ROS1 positive, 100 (66.4-100); ROS1 negative, 99.0 (94.6-100); MET positive, 98.0 (89.0-99.9); MET negative 100 (92.8-100); RET positive, 93.8 (69.8-100); RET negative, 99.8 (94.9-100). The analytical performance showed that the compact panel could handle various types of biopsy samples obtained by routine clinical practice without requiring strict pathological monitoring, as in the case of conventional NGS panels.

                             One of the major paradigms in modern cancer therapy is the prediction of the efficacy of anticancer agents based on genomic information from the patient. The foremost example of this paradigm is therapy for advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Molecular-targeted agents are selected for patients based on mutations in target genes, a process called companion diagnostics. The era of precision medicine began with the discovery of a correlation between EGFR mutations and efficacy

                             Previously, only EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors were available and diagnostic tests for one gene were sufficient for practical use. However, with an increasing number of agents, there is now a strong demand for testing multiple genes simultaneously. In this context, gene panels, next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels, namely analytical/diagnostic systems to detect variants in multiple cancer-related genes using NGS, such as Foundation One CDx (Foundation Medicine, Inc.) and Oncomine Dx Target Test (Thermo Fisher Scientific), should be useful.

                             However, these panels are not necessarily optimized for diagnostic purposes. The main limitation is the restriction of tumor samples; high tumor content (>20%) is required for panel tests. This restriction prevents a considerable proportion of the samples from being tested, and such samples must be subjected to single-gene tests based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These NGS panels were originally developed for samples collected for research purposes and are not optimized for testing various types of clinical samples in the real world. This shortcoming is mainly due to the low sensitivity of variant detection. We developed an NGS panel, named the compact panel, for companion diagnostics of NSCLC. The compact panel achieved a higher sensitivity than conventional NGS panels and single-gene tests. This panel was approved as a medical device by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan on November 16, 2022.

                              The compact panel limits the number of target genes to improve the flexibility of the panel design. The panel consisted of four modules: two DNA modules and two RNA modules, using DNA and RNA as templates, respectively. The target mutations were as follows: DNA module I for EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR L858R, BRAF V600E, and KRAS G12C; DNA module II for other EGFR mutations, Her2 exon 20, and MET exon 14 skipping/amplification; RNA module I for ALK and MET fusion genes; and RNA module II for ROS1 and RET fusion genes.

Additionally, the replacement or addition of modules can help address new diagnostic genes in the future.

Multiplex PCR is designed to optimize the amplification of fusions, thus reducing the number of normal genes among the amplified products. Consequently, a high sensitivity was achieved.

                             Companion diagnostics has long been performed using real-time PCR-based tests for individual genes. However, due to the increasing number of target genes, there is a strong demand for the simultaneous testing of multiple genes. In this context, the simultaneous analysis of multiple genes using NGS is ideal. In the USA, NGS panels were performed in 44% of patients with NSCLC who require genetic test

                             However, the introduction of NGS panels into Japanese medical practice is not straightforward. In the USA, NSCLC samples subjected to genetic tests are usually obtained by core needle biopsy or transthoracic fine needle aspiration biopsy guided by computed tomography or ultrasound

                             . In contrast, biopsy using bronchoscopy is more popular in Japan. This difference in biopsy practice causes a unique problem that is not apparent in the medical environment in the USA. In Japan, the feasibility of NGS panels is generally lower than that of other diagnostics in clinical practice, especially regarding nonsurgical biopsy

                             This issue can be addressed by introducing a new NGS panel with high sensitivity. We developed a compact panel, an NGS panel that accommodates various types of NSCLC samples without requiring strict pathological monitoring. The sensitivity of the compact panel suggested the detection of mutation/fusion in samples with 1% tumor content. The confirmed detection limit of DNA module I of the compact panel, which is 1% mutation allele frequency, is lower than that of the Oncomine Dx Target Test, which is 6−13%, and Cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2, which is 1.26−6.81% (FDA Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data). Because the amount of DNA/RNA required is only 5 ng, a smaller amount of tissue would need to be obtained by routine biopsy practice. Although the compact panel was originally designed for the Japanese medical environment, such high-sensitivity NGS panels would also benefit other medical environments.
