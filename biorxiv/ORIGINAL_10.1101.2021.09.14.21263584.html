                              Chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) has been found at high frequency in several lowland agricultural areas. Whether CKDu occurs in other countries with large agricultural populations remains uncertain, primarily due to lack of systematic data on kidney function. Hemoglobin (Hgb) levels are an ancillary marker for kidney dysfunction. We estimate the causal effect of agricultural work on Hgb level in men. A causal effect may indicate the presence of CKDu.

                              We use Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from seven African and Asian countries to estimate the causal effect of agricultural work on altitude-adjusted Hgb levels after adjusting for seven measured confounders. To assess potential bias due to unmeasured socioeconomic differences, we use multiple control groups that differ in non-agricultural occupation. We conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our causal conclusions to unmeasured confounding.

On average, Hgb levels were 0.09 g/dL lower among agricultural workers compared to matched controls.

                              We find evidence that men engaged in agricultural work in four of the seven countries studied have modestly lower Hgb levels compared with comparable men. Since underlying kidney disease could be a potential explanation for this finding, our data support consideration to integrating kidney function assessments within DHS surveys and other population-based surveys.

                             On a population-wide level, lacking data on serum creatinine assessments, hemoglobin (Hgb) levels could be an ancillary marker for presence of kidney dysfunction. Hgb is measured in several surveys that reach populations residing in low- and middle-income countries.

                             Since Hgb levels are systematically measured in the DHS, we sought to evaluate their association with occupation, with the hypothesis that Hgb levels would be lower among men working in agriculture than among men working in other occupations after accounting for age, and nutritional and wealth indices. Such a finding is potentially indicative of an under-recognized higher prevalence of kidney dysfunction among agricultural workers, and would support rationale for integrating systematic screening for kidney disease by occupation in future DHS surveys as well as other national or regional disease surveillance systems.

DHS adjusted its measured Hgb of male workers for altitudes higher than 1,000 meters since oxygen is less available as altitude increases so effective hemoglobin count is lowered (see Supplementary Materials Section 1 for details on the adjustment).

                              Agricultural workers and non-agricultural workers may differ substantially in the seven measured confounders (age, body mass index, wealth index, education, marital status, religion, and degree of cluster rurality) and these confounders may affect Hgb. Consequently, a direct comparison of the average Hgb levels of the agricultural workers and nonagricultural workers may be biased. To address this potential bias, we constructed matched sets of agricultural workers and non-agricultural rural workers who are similar on the measured confounders. We then compared Hgb levels within these matched sets of comparable agricultural and nonagricultural workers. To construct the matched sets, we implemented optimal full matching

The standardized difference of a confounder before matching is the difference between the means of the confounder for the agricultural workers vs. controls (non-agricultural workers) in within group pooled standard deviation units while the standardized difference after matching is the weighted average of the difference in means within matched sets between the agricultural workers and controls in the same within group pooled standard deviation units as before matching where the weighting is by the number of agricultural workers in the matched set.

We considered two control groups of men – (i) men who had professional, managerial, clerical, and sales occupations and (ii) men who had other non-agricultural occupations (manual labor, household, and domestic services, other and not working). Control group (i) had higher measured wealth and education (mean wealth quintile = 3.32; proportion with higher than secondary education = 31.4%) than control group (ii) (mean wealth quintile = 2.65; proportion with higher than secondary education = 9.7%) and likely higher unmeasured aspects of socioeconomic status, which could affect the outcome of interest – altitude-adjusted Hgb. Control group (ii) has higher measured wealth and education than agricultural workers (mean wealth quintile = 2.39; proportion with higher than secondary education = 4.7%) but is closer to agricultural workers than to control group (i). We call control group (i) the better-off controls and control group (ii) the worse-off controls.

To further reduce the bias for estimating the treatment effect due to measured confounding, we combined the techniques of permutation test and covariance adjustment – regressing men’s Hgb levels on the measured confounders and then conducting permutation tests on the residuals from matched sets.

                              In the sensitivity analysis, we consider different possible values of the sensitivity parameter Γ which is, for two participants with the same measured confounders, the maximum the odds ratio for being an agricultural worker could be for one participant compared to the other because of unmeasured confounding variables. For example, if the unmeasured confounding consisted of HIV status, Γ would be the odds ratio that a person with HIV would be an agricultural worker compared to a person with the same measured confounders (i.e., age, BMI, education, marital status, religion, and wealth quintile) who does not have HIV. If Γ = 1, then there is no unmeasured confounding while the more Γ departs from 1, the more unmeasured confounding there is. We cannot know Γ since it is determined by unobserved variables, but we can consider different possible Γ, compute both a lower bound and an upper bound for the p-value that tests whether there is a treatment effect if that Γ were true, and continue until the p-value upper bound is greater than 0.05 to determine the sensitivity value, the maximum amount of unmeasured confounding there could be and still obtain a significant effect of treatment. The larger the sensitivity value is, the more robust the study’s conclusions are to unmeasured confounding. We performed the sensitivity analysis using the R package “sensitivityfull”.

                              summarizes the seven measured confounders among agricultural and non-agricultural workers in rural areas. In our study population, agricultural workers tended to be older and have slightly lower body mass index than non-agricultural workers. They were more likely to be married, have lower educational attainment, and fall in the bottom two wealth quintiles than non-agricultural workers.

                              displays the altitude-adjusted Hgb levels for both the agricultural and all control workers across seven DHS country samples before full matching. Altitude-adjusted Hgb levels varied significantly by country. The median altitude-adjusted Hgb levels across all samples’ treated and all control groups were between 13.5 and 15.1 g/dL.

                              We calculated the standardized differences before and after matching for agricultural workers vs. all controls from seven DHS country samples respectively (Section 4 of the Supplementary Materials). Before matching, the absolute values of the standardized differences for most confounders were larger than 0.2 for most country samples, which indicates that the two groups were not adequately balanced. After matching, all the absolute values of the standardized differences were reduced below 0.2, suggesting adequate balances on the seven confounders was achieved. Matching for the comparisons of the agricultural workers vs. each control group and the comparison of control groups also achieved adequate balances.

                              , the whole sample consisted of all seven selected DHS samples and samples including Ethiopia, India, Lesotho, Senegal, and Uganda were respectively identified with statistically significant treatment effects. The result of sensitivity analysis for these samples is in Section 5 of the Supplementary Materials. For the whole sample, the sensitivity value of Γ to reach p-value upper bound 0.05 was 1.08. This means that if there were an unmeasured confounder that increases the odds of being an agricultural worker by 7%, we still have evidence (p-value upper bound < 0.05) that being an agricultural worker causes a reduction in Hgb. For the four country samples, the sensitivity values Γ to reach p-value upper bound 0.05 were between 1.03 and 1.10. Lesotho had the highest sensitivity value (1.10), and Senegal had the lowest sensitivity value (1.03).

                             In this study of rural men participating in DHS surveys in six African and one Asian country, we found a consistent and modest effect of agricultural work on Hgb, indicating that agricultural workers have lower Hgb levels than other men residing in rural areas. This effect held up when a quasi-experimental device – multiple control groups – was used to examine concerns about unmeasured confounding. Since kidney dysfunction may be one potential explanation for our finding, we posit that our data provide rationale for systematic surveys of kidney function by occupation, especially in countries with large proportions of populations engaged in agricultural work.

                             Our observed effect size is modest (Hgb lower by ∼ 0.1 g/dL among agricultural workers versus other rural men), but it is concordant with effect sizes described in prior studies among persons with mild kidney dysfunction.

                             We expect participation in DHS to be subject to survivor bias, and thus few, if any, persons who develop advanced kidney disease and substantial anemia, are likely present in our analytic cohort. Furthermore, our findings were robust to consideration of multiple control groups of occupations that tend to have higher and lower socioeconomic status, and a modest amount of unmeasured confounding.

                             Hgb level is an admittedly imperfect surrogate marker of kidney dysfunction. That said, few population-based data exist on kidney function and incidence of kidney dysfunction in agricultural communities. Even among the best described hotspots of “CKDu”, systematic surveys of prevalence and incidence of kidney dysfunction are lacking. Without better mapping of affected regions and populations, identification – and prevention – of risk factors for development of kidney dysfunction in marginalized populations is unlikely. The International Society of Nephrology has put forth a simple minimal data set inclusive of serum creatinine and urine dipsticks to assist with integration of kidney function in population surveys.

                             However, the cause of CKDu remains unclear for many reasons, including due to the potentially long lag between exposure and disease, lack of advanced research infrastructure, and political unrest.

                             – this could increase the desirability of in-depth investigations into cause. Our analysis is an attempt to evaluate the possibility of this broader link, using available data, and supports further direct investigations of kidney function by occupation.

                             The limitations of our study include limited data on confounders of the relationship between occupation and hemoglobin including water quality or HIV status. Either the DHS did not measure these factors or there were too many missing values for the sample surveys we selected. In addition, since the DHS did not separately categorize 16,798 skilled and unskilled manual laborers, we were not able to put them into different alternative control groups for the four comparisons. However the two primary confounders we expected to influence the relationship between occupation and hemoglobin levels were nutrition and socioeconomic status. We accounted for these major confounders using body mass index, marital status, and religion (which can influence diet) for the former, and wealth index, educational level, and degree of rurality for the latter. Furthermore, our matching procedure resulted in near perfectly balanced distribution of these confounders among the agricultural workers and their non-agricultural worker counterparts.

                             We recommend that DHS and other population-based surveys add measurements about agricultural workers’ kidney function assessments in their future standard surveys for African and Asian countries. Further studies are warranted investigating the link between agricultural work and kidney dysfunction in the four countries – Ethiopia, India, Lesotho, and Senegal – where we did find evidence of lower Hgb among agricultural workers.
