  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Objective This study examined the relationship between job accommodations for workers with poor health and work functioning impairment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods An internet survey was conducted in December 2020. We included 24,429 subjects for analysis. One question was used to determine whether subjects needed job accommodations from their company to continue working in their current health condition. The odds ratios (ORs) of the necessity of job accommodations for sick workers associated with work functioning impairment were estimated using multilevel logistic regression analysis.

Results The OR of work functioning impairment among sick workers not receiving job accommodations was 5.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.34-6.20, p<0.001) and those receiving job accommodations was 1.88 (95% CI 1.69-2.08, p<0.001) compared to healthy workers.

Conclusions This study suggests that providing job accommodations to workers with poor health may improve their work functioning impairment.

                              An internet survey was conducted in December 2020. We included 24,429 subjects for analysis. One question was used to determine whether subjects needed job accommodations from their company to continue working in their current health condition. The odds ratios (ORs) of the necessity of job accommodations for sick workers associated with work functioning impairment were estimated using multilevel logistic regression analysis.

                             We hypothesized that job accommodations for workers with poor health during the COVID-19 pandemic would improve or maintain work performance. Thus, we examined the relationship between job accommodations provided by companies for workers with poor health and a decline in work performance due to presenteeism during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also stratified our analysis by job type, because the relationship between workers with poor health and decreased work performance is hypothesized to differ by the type of job being performed. Different job types can have different characteristics, such as physical demands, loads from the physical environment, and mental strains from overwork and interpersonal communication.

Fraudulent responses were defined as follows: extremely short response time (≤6 minutes), extremely low body weight (<30 kg), extremely short height (<140 cm), inconsistent answers to similar questions throughout the survey (e.g., inconsistency to questions about marital status and living area), and wrong answers to a staged question used to identify fraudulent responses (choose the third largest number from the following five numbers). Because job accommodations such as job adjustments, workplace support, and improvements to the work environment are provided to workers by companies or supervisors, we only included employed workers. A total of 2,607 subjects who indicated that their occupation was self-employed or SOHO (Small Office, Home Office) were excluded because self-employed workers cannot receive job accommodations from the company.

The odds of mild to severe work functioning impairment in age- and sex-adjusted subjects were 5.75 times higher among sick workers not receiving job accommodations and 1.88 times higher among sick workers receiving job accommodations from their company than healthy workers. After adjusting for household income, educational status, the number of employees at the workplace, and marriage status, the odds of mild to severe work functioning impairment were 5.59 times higher among sick workers not receiving job accommodations and 1.85 times higher among sick workers receiving job accommodations from their company than healthy workers.

                             This study examined the relationship between job accommodations provided by companies for workers with poor health and work functioning impairment in a large population living in Japan. The odds of mild to severe work functioning impairment among workers who were not receiving job accommodations were 5.8 times higher than those of workers who did not need job accommodations. Meanwhile, the odds of mild to severe work functioning impairment among workers who were not receiving job accommodations were 1.9 times higher than those of workers who did not need job accommodations. The reduced risk of work functioning impairment for workers receiving job accommodations suggests that providing job accommodations to workers with poor health may improve worker performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a relationship between job accommodations for workers with poor health and work functioning impairment in Japan.

                             We showed that workers with poor health have higher work functioning impairment than those who are healthy. Individuals who work with health problems have been reported to experience work disability and lower work productivity

                             . There are a variety of reasons why workers with poor health have reduced work ability. First, the nature of their symptoms or illness can reduce workers’ ability to perform their job or certain tasks. For example, pain or musculoskeletal diseases, which are typical causes of presenteeism, lead to decreased physical tolerance and hinder performance in tasks such as handling heavy objects. In addition, sleep disorders and mental health problems, which are a major cause of presenteeism, impair concentration and cognitive function
                             <sup>

                             . Some conditions require workers to restrict certain tasks, such as shift work, business trips, and work at heights, to ensure safety and to avoid worsening their condition. Second, hospitalization and hospital visits for treatment may reduce working hours and interrupt work schedules. Individuals who work while experiencing work-related disability due to presenteeism have an increased risk of future days off work, job loss, and exclusion from the labor market

                             . Providing appropriate job accommodations to workers, such as changing the contents of their work and adjusting their working hours, is expected to decrease the loss in work performance due to presenteeism and to reduce the risk of lost work days and unemployment.

                             Job accommodations can reduce work functioning impairment among workers with poor health. In this study, we found that the odds of mild to severe work functioning impairment was approximately three times higher among workers who were not receiving job accommodations than those who were receiving job accommodations. Workers with poor health experience a variety of difficulties performing their duties and continuing to work. Providing job accommodations for workers with poor health in the form of adjustments to work hours and shifts, job descriptions to match their work ability, and changes to the physical work environment can help them adjust to work. Accommodations provided by supervisors and coworkers are also thought to enhance the effectiveness of these actions. Additionally, a good health climate, or the perception by employees that the team to which they belong cares about health issues, and their handling and communication of related matters, are also thought to contribute. A previous study reported that greater accommodations from supervisors and colleagues are associated with lower work productivity loss due to presenteeism

                             We observed a similar relationship between job accommodations for workers with poor health and work functioning impairment across the job types examined. We divided occupations into three groups, namely primarily desk jobs, primarily interpersonal communication, and primarily physical labor. Different job types have different degrees of psychological and physical demands. Workers with back pain who engage in physical work naturally require different accommodations to those undergoing anti-cancer drug treatment who work at a desk. While we did not identify the details of the accommodations provided, our results nevertheless suggest that providing accommodations for workers based on their job type and health condition that are in line with their needs is useful for slowing or halting the decline in work functioning impairment across all job types. While job accommodations are increasingly being recommended for workers with poor health, there remains no unified view on the best types of accommodations to offer workers with certain illnesses and performing certain jobs. Job accommodations are currently being chosen through collaboration among workers, employers, attending physicians, and industrial physicians. In the future, studies may identify concrete recommendations of the most effective type of accommodations to provide workers according to job type.

                             This study had some limitations. First, because we conducted a survey of Internet monitors, a degree of selection bias was unavoidable. To minimize this, we selected subjects based on their region, occupation, and prefecture according to the cumulative infection rate from January to December 2020. Second, given the cross-sectional design, we could not determine the causal relationship between job accommodations provided by companies for workers with poor health and work functioning impairment. Workers with mild work functioning impairment who are able to work may receive job accommodations more readily. Third, we did not identify workers’ symptoms or disease in our study. The effect of job accommodations on the improvement in work functioning impairment may depend on the type and degree of poor health or symptoms exhibited by workers, combined with their job and tasks. Fourth, we used only one question to assess whether or not workers were receiving job accommodations from their company, which may not be sufficiently valid.

                             In conclusion, this study showed that there is a relationship between job accommodations provided by companies for workers with poor health and work functioning impairment in a large population of workers across Japan. Workers with poor health who were receiving job accommodations were less likely to have work functioning impairment than those who reported not receiving job accommodations. These results suggest that providing accommodations to workers with poor health may improve their work functioning impairment.
