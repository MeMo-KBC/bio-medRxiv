                              The increase in ectopic pregnancies (EP) in recent years and their impact on female fertility forces physicians to find an effective medical treatment that can avoid surgery as soon as possible. Methotrexate and mifepristone are widely used in conservative treatments, but the effectiveness of this combination is not completely clear. Therefore, the aims in this meta-analysis are to systematically analyze the efficacy of mifepristone combined with methotrexate in the treatment of EP through existing studies and draw a conclusion, to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of inclusion trials and propose improvement measures and scientific designing schemes.

Randomized controlled trials published up to October 2020 will be selected. Search terms include mifepristone, methotrexate, EP, and random (free word/synonym expansion). We will include trials in which the experimental group was treated with combination of mifepristone and methotrexate, and the control group was treated with mifepristone alone. Revman 5.4 will be used to evaluate the quality of the trials, and the effect model will be selected to analyze the results. Cure rate will be the main outcome index.

                             EP is when blastocyst is implanted outside the uterus, most of which is fallopian tube pregnancy. EP is a common clinical acute abdominal disease in obstetrics and gynecology, as well as one of the primary causes of maternal death. In recent years, the incidence of EP has increased year by year and has shown a trend of patients of younger age. Domestic literature in China reports that the minimum age of onset of EP is 16 years old[

                             ], besides, the incidence rate in pregnant women is 2% while the mortality rate accounts for about 10% of the total maternal deaths [

                             ]. In Liu Ying’s study, the incidence rate increased from 2.48% in 2005 to 4.36% in 2012, and the proportion of conservative treatment increased from 7.14% to 20.73% [

                             ]. Tang Lirong analyzed the factors associated with the incidence of EP in patients from October 1997 to September 1998 (the latter group) and from October 2007 to September 2008 (the former group). The proportion under 20 years old in the later group increased from 1.1% 10 years ago to 4.5%. Unmarried women increased from 21.5% to 41.4%; The number of childless women rose from 45.7% to 66.8%[

                             ]. Therefore, patients with EP tend to be younger, unmarried, and childless.

                             Since embryo implantation in the uterus is a complex developmental process, the molecular interaction mechanism is still unclear, especially for tubal EP. What is certain is that once pregnant, the trophoblast cells begin to secrete a large amount of hCG, and at the same time, the trophoblast cells also secrete substances that can distinguish between normal pregnancy and abnormal pregnancy.[
                             <a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">

                             </a>
                             ] Research has shown that the β-HCG level of EP patients is lower than that of normal pregnant women because blastocyst cannot receive enough blood supply, the development of the placenta is limited and the trophoblast layer is mostly dysplastic [
                             <a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">

                             </a>
                             ]. Therefore, β-HCG level can be used as an index of diagnosis and differential diagnosis of EP. On the other hand, EP can be difficult to detect in the early stage, but as the disease progresses, the gestational sac (mass) will grow, and the patient may experience sudden and intense abdominal pain, or irregular vaginal bleeding, and other symptoms. The clinical symptoms above can be detected by ultrasound examination, which can also be considered as an appropriate tool for the diagnosis of EP.

                             In conclusion, because of the increasing incidence of EP, early diagnosing and treating EP patients in order to effectively save their lives and furthest preserve fallopian tube function and fertility is particularly important. Meanwhile, because of the various diagnostic methods, the spread of hygienic knowledge, and the wide application of transvaginal ultrasound examination and β-HCG test, it is possible to early diagnose EP and create opportunities for conservative treatment.

                             Drug therapy is one of the conservative treatments of EP, which first appeared in the 1980s and is still widely used nowadays. It is confirmed that drug therapy can prevent patients from surgical trauma and complications, such as pelvic adhesion, and furthest preserve fallopian tube function and increase fertility rate [

                             ]. Nowadays, the common drugs include methotrexate, mifepristone, hypertonic glucose, prostaglandin, potassium chloride, fluorouracil, traditional Chinese medicine, etc., among which methotrexate and mifepristone are most widely used, and they are often used in combination for clinical application.

                             Mifepristone is a steroidal anti-progesterone drug, the main principle of its treatment of EP is: blocking the secretion of progesterone to shrink corpus luteum, causing cells degeneration, decidua, and chorion decrease. Mifepristone can also promote the release of endogenous prostaglandins, causing uterine contractions, cervical softening and dilation, and assisting ectopic embryo tissue discharge [

                             The specific mechanism to function includes two stages: molecular mechanism and biological effect. Among them, the process of molecular mechanism is: (1) It competitively binds to the progesterone receptor activation domain, thereby antagonizing progesterone activity. The progesterone receptor(PR) has three independent isomers(PR-A, PR-B, PR-C), and PR-A has two transcription activation domains that mainly mediate endometrial hyperplasia [

                             ] and progesterone binds to the 42-amino acid sequence at PR-C to exert biological effects. But mifepristone can bind to the hormone-binding domain at the PR-N tail due to the characteristics of its phenyl group at the 11βsite, thus, progesterone is 5 times stronger than PR affinity, which antagonizes the progesterone activity. (2) It has initiating/inhibiting effects: Mifepristone can effectively activate inhibiting factors, such as nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR), retinoic acid silencing mediator, etc. It can also activate promoters of target genes of the response element, and its initiation/inhibition effects depend on the relative concentration of the promoters/repressors produced [

                             ]. (3) Mifepristone has a high affinity with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and relatively weak interactions with other steroid hormone receptors [

When mifepristone is used alone during an abortion, the elimination time of it from the body is generally 34 hours, which is relatively slow, and incomplete abortion may occur. In recent years, there have been many reports on the treatment of EP with mifepristone. Compared with methotrexate, which has similar effects, mifepristone has no obvious adverse reaction, and the treatment success rate is higher, and it can also better reduce the pain of pregnant women.

                             Methotrexate is an anti-tumor drug, mainly anti-folate. MTX binds effectively with folate reductase pharmacologically, and strongly inhibits dihydrofolate reductase in a competitive way, so that dihydrofolate cannot be transformed into tetrahydrofolate, which acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymine nucleotides, thus destroying the synthesis of DNA, and competitively inhibiting the effective synthesis of DNA, RNA, and other proteins. So it is a commonly used clinical anti-tumor immunosuppressant.

                             In recent years, MTX has the best effect on conservative treatment of EP. There are systemic administration and local administration of it. A study has shown that patients with low HCG levels can receive systemic administration of MTX instead of laparoscopic surgery. Systemic administration includes continuous intravenous administration and single intramuscular injection. It was shown that the clinical effective rates of continuous intravenous administration and single intramuscular injection were 94.9% and 96.2% respectively, and the incidence rate of blood cell count reduction were 16.7% and 3.9%, which indicates that the difference between the curative effects of continuous intravenous administration and single intramuscular injection isn’t significant. However, the incidence rate of blood cell count reduction in continuous intravenous dosing patients was significantly higher than that in those patients with single intramuscular injection. Thus, it is better to use single intramuscular injection treatments for patients with a low level of HCG, because of its better curative effect, simpler operation, and fewer adverse reactions, which brings higher clinical value [

At present, there are few RCTs about the combination therapy on EP, while there are lots of researches with uneven quality and different methods in China.

There has been no meta-analysis of clinical trials in recent years at home and abroad. There was only one meta-analysis going back to 2011, but it was not registered and published on Prospero, and there was a lack of flow charts, basic information sheets, and a forest plot of outcome indicators.

We will categorize each item into one of these three levels—“high risk”, “low risk” or“unknown risk”. Those with low risk will be scored 1 point, while those with high risk and unknown risk will be not scored. The final bias score of each study will be calculated to evaluate the overall risk: 0-2 is considered as overall high risk, 3-4 as unknown risk, and 5-6 as overall low risk.

                             Patients with EP who are young and childless should accept conservative treatment, for the reasons that the function of the oviduct can be protected from damage, and achieve an optimal treatment effect. Methotrexate is folic acid anti-metabolite, as well as a preferred medicine to treat EP admittedly. And mifepristone is a progestin antagonist, which also can destroy the embryo. However, there are limitations if only mifepristone is used. On the contrary, mifepristone combined with methotrexate to treat EP can achieve mutual advantages and interaction, which brings advantages and potential in clinical application.

                             We will assess the efficacy of the combination of mifepristone and methotrexate to treat EP comprehensively, by Meta-analysis based on the literature in recent years. Considering the quality of literature varies widely and international opinions to the efficacy are different, we expect that scientific conclusion about the efficacy can be shown through this analysis, and at the same time find out the primary cause to low quality of most trials and unreliable research results, to give some advice about how to improve the research and make scientific designing schemes, at the same time meeting the domestic and international research field’s needs.

                             What’s more, the site of onset of pregnancy can be taken into account and further studied. The quantitative interaction between effect of combination of mifepristone and methotrexate treatment and base line serum progesterone suggested that this combination could be reserved to ectopic pregnancies associated with high serum progesterone concentrations [

                             ]. Mifepristone has different effects on different types of ectopic pregnancy, Guglielmo Stabile thinks that mifepristone has good efficacy in the treatment of intrauterine pregnancy or interstitial pregnancy is because of its effect on decidua. While in tubal pregnancy, its effect is reduced by the presence of a discontinuous deciduous islet [
