  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Objective To evaluate the clinical and cost savings benefits of adoption of a carrier screen with reflex single-gene non-invasive prenatal test (sgNIPT) in prenatal care.

Method A decision-analytic model was developed to compare carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT (maternal carrier status and fetal risk reported together) as first-line carrier screening to the traditional carrier screening workflow (positive maternal carrier screen followed by paternal screening to evaluate fetal risk). The model compared the clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness between the two screening methods. These results were used to simulate appropriate pricing for reflex sgNIPT.

Results Reflex sgNIPT carrier screening detected 108 of 110 affected pregnancies per 100,000 births (98.5% sensitivity), whereas traditional carrier screening detected 46 of 110 affected pregnancies (41.5% sensitivity). The cost to identify one affected pregnancy was reduced by 62% in the reflex sgNIPT scenario compared to the traditional scenario. Adding together the testing cost savings and the savings from earlier clinical intervention made possible by reflex sgNIPT, the total cost savings was $37.6 million per 100,000 pregnancies. Based on these cost savings, we simulated appropriate reflex sgNIPT pricing range: if the cost to identify one affected pregnancy is the unit cost, carrier screening with reflex sgNIPT can be priced up to $1,859 per test (or $7,233 if sgNIPT is billed separately); if the cost per 100,000 pregnancies is the unit cost, carrier screening with sgNIPT can be priced up to $1,070 per test (or $2,336 if sgNIPT is billed separately).

Conclusion Using the carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT as first-line screening improves the detection of affected fetuses by 2.4-fold and can save costs for the healthcare system. A real-life experience will be needed to assess the clinical utility and exact cost savings of carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT.

                              A decision-analytic model was developed to compare carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT (maternal carrier status and fetal risk reported together) as first-line carrier screening to the traditional carrier screening workflow (positive maternal carrier screen followed by paternal screening to evaluate fetal risk). The model compared the clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness between the two screening methods. These results were used to simulate appropriate pricing for reflex sgNIPT.

                              Reflex sgNIPT carrier screening detected 108 of 110 affected pregnancies per 100,000 births (98.5% sensitivity), whereas traditional carrier screening detected 46 of 110 affected pregnancies (41.5% sensitivity). The cost to identify one affected pregnancy was reduced by 62% in the reflex sgNIPT scenario compared to the traditional scenario. Adding together the testing cost savings and the savings from earlier clinical intervention made possible by reflex sgNIPT, the total cost savings was $37.6 million per 100,000 pregnancies. Based on these cost savings, we simulated appropriate reflex sgNIPT pricing range: if the cost to identify one affected pregnancy is the unit cost, carrier screening with reflex sgNIPT can be priced up to $1,859 per test (or $7,233 if sgNIPT is billed separately); if the cost per 100,000 pregnancies is the unit cost, carrier screening with sgNIPT can be priced up to $1,070 per test (or $2,336 if sgNIPT is billed separately).

                              Using the carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT as first-line screening improves the detection of affected fetuses by 2.4-fold and can save costs for the healthcare system.

                             Carrier screening is a genetic testing methodology that aims to identify individuals or couples who carry one variant allele within a gene and are at risk of having offspring with the associated genetic disorder.

                             The primary goal of carrier screening is to identify high-risk fetuses so that patients and providers can make informed decisions about undergoing diagnostic testing and considering prenatal and neonatal interventions. In the traditional carrier screen, pregnant patients are first carrier screened. While one in six pregnant patients is a carrier, only one in 900 newborns is affected with CF, SMA, or hemoglobinopathies, indicating that >99% of carrier pregnant patients carry unaffected fetuses. If the maternal carrier screen is positive, the next step is paternal carrier screening. If both parents are carriers, the fetus has a 1 in 4 risk of being affected and diagnostic testing is needed to determine disease status. However, the paternal carrier screen follow-up rate is low due to financial, societal, and logistical barriers.

Because the sgNIPT portion of the screen is not currently billed to payors or patients due to its recent commercial introduction, we use these cost savings results to explore appropriate pricing for the screen.

                              Third, the model focused on the comparison of workflows from the start of the carrier screening to the identification of high-risk fetuses, with both mother and father being identified as carriers in the base scenario and receiving a high-risk sgNIPT result in the reflex sgNIPT scenario. Due to the difference in how the tests are offered, uptake of the traditional carrier screening panels and the carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT panel among patients may vary. Further, due to the difference in reported fetal risk (25% fetal risk based on autosomal recessive inheritance with the traditional screening method, and 25-90% fetal risk based on internal criteria for carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT), uptake of diagnostic testing such as amniocentesis after the high-risk screening result may differ. However, given the insufficient data to fully simulate these differences, the uptake of diagnostic testing was excluded from the comparison model.

                              The reflex sgNIPT scenario reduced the need for paternal screening, thus significantly lowering follow-up costs per 100,000 pregnancies.

Moreover, the single-dose gene therapy Zolgensma ($2.1M per dose) is more cost-effective than the lifetime medication Spinraza ($0.75M for initial dose and $0.46M per year afterward) (

                              ). However, Zolgensma must be administered to neonates before two years of age. Since SMA is not included in newborn screening panels in all U.S. states (twelve states do not test for SMA as of June 2021), prenatal SMA diagnosis is essential for affected families to have access to early, clinically effective, and cost effective treatment options.

The cost savings per 100,000 births is most sensitive to inputs that affect SMA treatment costs, including the base scenario SMA diagnosis rate before age two and the number of eligible SMA patients who chose Zolgensma. For example, a low base diagnosis rate (40%) results in relatively higher cost savings (up to $68.1M) and a high base diagnosis rate (80%) results in relatively lower cost savings ($27.4M). Additionally, the model is also sensitive to the percent of eligible SMA patients who choose Zolgensma over Spinraza. These two inputs are difficult to know with confidence because several U.S. states do not offer SMA newborn screening or are in the process of implementing it,

If paternal follow-up is low (20%), the cost savings for sgNIPT decrease to $32.8M per 100,000 pregnancies because fewer follow-up tests are needed (

                             Results from our decision-analytic model analyses show that compared to the traditional sequential carrier screen workflow, the carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT workflow improves clinical outcome (detection of affected fetuses) and saves costs by eliminating paternal carrier screening and enabling more cost-effective SMA treatment interventions. Furthermore, we identified carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT pricing that would preserve cost savings for the healthcare system.

                             Carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT detects more affected pregnancies with less burden on the healthcare system. Although the traditional workflow is effective for detecting carriers of autosomal recessive conditions, the detection rate of high-risk fetuses is limited to 41.5%, as the lack of paternal follow-up testing is significant and leaves >58% of carrier pregnant patients without a fully informative risk assessment for their pregnancy.

                             In contrast, the reflex sgNIPT carrier screen provides patients and physicians with a personalized risk for the fetus, allowing for more informed counseling, decision-making, and patient autonomy regarding follow-up testing and interventions. Additionally, the reduced need for paternal follow-up testing may significantly lower the burden on the physician, clinical staff, and patient, given the logistics involved in counseling about and arranging paternal testing.

                             Second, the reflex sgNIPT workflow reduces the time from blood draw to identification of high-risk fetuses by up to eight weeks compared to the traditional workflow. Early identification of high-risk fetuses will improve pregnancy and delivery management, patient counseling and education, and access to early intervention, therapeutics, research studies, and clinical trials. With pregnancies affected with alpha thalassemia, for example, only patients at 18 to 26 weeks gestational age are eligible for the in-utero hematopoietic stem cell transplantation clinical study.

                             Faster turnaround time with reflex sgNIPT increases the likelihood of meeting the eligibility criteria and receiving treatment. Several treatment options, for example gene therapies for SMA, are most effective when implemented prior to the onset of symptoms. Uptake of genetic counseling and patient education after a positive newborn screen is low for some conditions.

                             The findings reported herein should be viewed considering several limitations. First, we recognize that paternal follow-up rates may vary between populations, within the U.S. or among different countries. The model can be refined if additional data on paternal follow-up rates are available. Second, clinical performance metrics in this report could change when data from a larger clinical study on the carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT become available. Third, since paternal carrier screening likely remains useful for future pregnancies of identified carriers or may be required by some laboratories as a control during diagnostic testing, the reflex sgNIPT workflow may not completely eliminate the cost of paternal testing, although it likely would reduce the urgency and frequency of the test. Fourth, cost savings from prenatal and neonatal interventions were calculated based on limited available literature, as many of these interventions are recent and rapidly evolving. While some of the data used in the models is dated, we chose the available data that was most applicable to the carrier screen clinical scenario. In particular, long-term data about extended life expectancy and outcomes for SMA patients treated with Spinraza or Zolgensma are still lacking, and the phenotypic severity is difficult to predict

                             . In addition, SMA newborn screening is rapidly changing and varies widely between countries, which would impact the cost savings amount.

Despite the above limitations, the current study provides a comprehensive assessment, using available data, on the clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness when using carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT as a first-line screening method versus the traditional sequential screening workflow.

                             Carrier screening with reflex sgNIPT improves clinical outcome by detecting fetuses at high risk for autosomal recessive disorders with higher sensitivity, giving patients and providers access to additional prenatal and neonatal intervention options. Furthermore, carrier screening with reflex sgNIPT can lead to significant cost savings to the healthcare system. While cost savings depends on the carrier screen with sgNIPT pricing (the current commercial test does not bill it), we used our model to explore pricing that saves costs for the system. If we define the unit cost as the cost to identify one affected fetus, a price less than $1,859 per carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT (or $7,233 if sgNIPT is billed separately) will save cost for the system. If we define the unit cost as the cost to screen 100,000 births, a price less than $1,070 per carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT (or $2,336 if sgNIPT is billed separately) will save cost for the system. Follow-up clinical studies are needed to assess the real-life clinical utility and cost savings of carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT.
