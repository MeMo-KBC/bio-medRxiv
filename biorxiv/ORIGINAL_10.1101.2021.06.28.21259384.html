  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Importance Women and gender-diverse individuals have faced disproportionate socioeconomic burden during COVID-19. There have been reports that this has translated into greater negative changes in mental health, but this has been based on cross-sectional research that has not accounted for pre-COVID-19 differences.

Objective To compare mental health symptom changes since pre-COVID-19 by sex or gender.

Data Sources MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, medRxiv, and Open Science Framework (December 31, 2019 to August 30, 2021).

Study Selection Eligible studies compared mental health symptom changes from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 by sex or gender.

Data Extraction and Synthesis Data was extracted by a single reviewer with validation by a second reviewer. Adequacy of study methods and reporting was assessed using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies. A restricted maximum-likelihood random-effects meta-analyses was conducted.

Main Outcomes and Measures Anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, general mental health, and stress measured continuously or dichotomously.

Results 12 studies (10 unique cohorts) were included. All compared females or women to males or men; none included gender-diverse individuals. Continuous symptom change differences were not statistically significant for depression (standardized mean difference [SMD]= 0.12, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.33; 4 studies, 4,475 participants; I2=69.0%) and stress (SMD= - 0.10, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.01; 4 studies, 1,533 participants; I2=0.0%), but anxiety (SMD= 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.22; 4 studies, 4,344 participants; I2=3.0%) and general mental health (SMD= 0.15, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.18; 3 studies, 15,692 participants; I2=0.0%) worsened more among females or women than males or men during COVID-19. There were no significant differences in changes in proportion above a cut-off: anxiety (difference= -0.05, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.11; 1 study, 217 participants), depression (difference= 0.12, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.28; 1 study, 217 participants), general mental health (difference= -0.03, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04; 3 studies, 18,985 participants; I2=94.0%), stress (difference= 0.04, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.17; 1 study, 217 participants).

Conclusion and Relevance Mental health outcomes did not differ or were worse by amounts below thresholds for clinical significance for women compared to men.

Registration PROSPERO (CRD42020179703).

Question Did mental health symptoms worsen more for females or women than males or men in COVID-19?

Findings We reviewed almost 65,000 citations and identified 12 studies that provided data to directly compare mental health symptom changes from pre-COVID-19 to during COVID-19 for females or women versus males or men. Statistically significant, but small, sex- or gender-based differences were found in 2 of 8 mental health outcomes.

Meaning Mental health changes among females or women were not significantly different from males or men for most outcomes, and differences that were identified were small and less than minimally important difference thresholds.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Importance Women and gender-diverse individuals have faced disproportionate socioeconomic burden during COVID-19. There have been reports that this has translated into greater negative changes in mental health, but this has been based on cross-sectional research that has not accounted for pre-COVID-19 differences.

Objective To compare mental health symptom changes since pre-COVID-19 by sex or gender.

Data Sources MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, medRxiv, and Open Science Framework (December 31, 2019 to August 30, 2021).

Study Selection Eligible studies compared mental health symptom changes from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 by sex or gender.

Data Extraction and Synthesis Data was extracted by a single reviewer with validation by a second reviewer. Adequacy of study methods and reporting was assessed using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies. A restricted maximum-likelihood random-effects meta-analyses was conducted.

Main Outcomes and Measures Anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, general mental health, and stress measured continuously or dichotomously.

Results 12 studies (10 unique cohorts) were included. All compared females or women to males or men; none included gender-diverse individuals. Continuous symptom change differences were not statistically significant for depression (standardized mean difference [SMD]= 0.12, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.33; 4 studies, 4,475 participants; I2=69.0%) and stress (SMD= - 0.10, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.01; 4 studies, 1,533 participants; I2=0.0%), but anxiety (SMD= 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.22; 4 studies, 4,344 participants; I2=3.0%) and general mental health (SMD= 0.15, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.18; 3 studies, 15,692 participants; I2=0.0%) worsened more among females or women than males or men during COVID-19. There were no significant differences in changes in proportion above a cut-off: anxiety (difference= -0.05, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.11; 1 study, 217 participants), depression (difference= 0.12, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.28; 1 study, 217 participants), general mental health (difference= -0.03, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04; 3 studies, 18,985 participants; I2=94.0%), stress (difference= 0.04, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.17; 1 study, 217 participants).

Conclusion and Relevance Mental health outcomes did not differ or were worse by amounts below thresholds for clinical significance for women compared to men.

Registration PROSPERO (CRD42020179703).

Question Did mental health symptoms worsen more for females or women than males or men in COVID-19?

Findings We reviewed almost 65,000 citations and identified 12 studies that provided data to directly compare mental health symptom changes from pre-COVID-19 to during COVID-19 for females or women versus males or men. Statistically significant, but small, sex- or gender-based differences were found in 2 of 8 mental health outcomes.

Meaning Mental health changes among females or women were not significantly different from males or men for most outcomes, and differences that were identified were small and less than minimally important difference thresholds.

                              Women and gender-diverse individuals have faced disproportionate socioeconomic burden during COVID-19. There have been reports that this has translated into greater negative changes in mental health, but this has been based on cross-sectional research that has not accounted for pre-COVID-19 differences.

We only included pre-COVID-19 data collected in the two years prior to COVID-19 to reduce comparisons of COVID-19 results with those collected during different developmental life stages. Compared samples had to include at least 90% of the same participants pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 or use statistical methods to account for missing follow-up data. Studies with < 100 participants were excluded for feasibility and due to their limited relative value. For the present analysis, studies had to report mental health outcomes separately by sex (assignment based on external genitalia, usually at birth; e.g., female, male, intersex) or gender (socially constructed characteristics of roles and behaviours; e.g., woman, man, trans woman, trans man, non-binary).

                             There has been an assumption, seemingly confirmed by cross-sectional data collected during COVID-19, that this has translated into greater negative changes in mental health among women.

                             We reviewed evidence from 12 studies (10 cohorts) that reported mental health changes from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 separately by sex or gender. We compared females or women with males or men; no studies compared gender minorities with any other group. Syntheses of continuously measured anxiety symptoms (SMD = 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.22) and general mental health (SMD = 0.15, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.18) found that mental health worsened more for females or women than males or men, but the magnitude was small and far below thresholds that are typically considered clinically important (e.g., SMD = 0.50).

                             This finding departs from what has been reported in some research and by the media. Three factors may feed this discrepancy. One is the publication of many cross-sectional studies that report proportions above cut-offs on self-report measures, which are not designed for that purpose,

                             A second is the use of surveys that ask questions about well-being with COVID-19 explicitly assigned as a cause; illustrating the pitfalls of this, a study of over 2,000 young Swiss adult men found significant angst when questions were asked in this way, but no changes in validated measures of depression symptoms and stress from pre-COVID.

                             A third reason relates to news media reports that emphasize dramatic events and anecdotes without evidence that demonstrates changes.

                             Strengths of our study include the use of rigorous systematic review methods. We searched 9 databases, including Chinese-language databases, without language restrictions and included studies that enabled the direct comparison of mental health changes by sex or gender. There are limitations to consider. First, this review only included 12 studies from 10 cohorts, and many had limitations related to study sampling frames and recruitment methods, follow-up rates, and management of missing data. Second, heterogeneity was high for some meta-analyses; it was low, however, for others, and results across 8 analyses did not differ substantively. Third, there were not enough studies to attempt sub-group analyses by additional sociodemographic or other factors. Fourth, we did not identify any studies that compared results from gender-diverse individuals to other gender groups. Fifth, in calculating 95% CIs for within-group changes in proportions with the information provided in publications (pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 group proportions), we assumed that 50% of pre-COVID-19 cases continued to be cases during COVID-19. However, the maximum difference in any end point of a 95% CIs across analyses was 0.02 when we varied our assumption from 30% to 70%.

                             In sum, we identified small sex- or gender-based differences for anxiety symptoms and general mental health, continuously measured, but other outcomes (continuous depression symptoms and stress; dichotomous anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, general mental health, and stress) did not differ by sex or gender. This finding diverges from what has been reported from cross-sectional studies. These are aggregate results, though, and many individuals have certainly experienced negative mental health changes related to increased socioeconomic burden. It seems plausible, given the divergent ways that the pandemic has affected different people that many people are experiencing improved mental health, whereas large numbers of others may be experiencing worsened mental health, including new onset mental disorders among people without previous morbidity. Thus, mental health changes should continue to be monitored in COVID-19, taking into consideration sex and gender, and studies should examine reasons for what appears to be resilience among many women despite facing disproportionate hardships in the pandemic. Health care providers should be alert to life changes that may be associated with vulnerability and to physical and emotional or cognitive symptoms that may reflect worsening mental health so that they can assess, if appropriate, and provide mental health care to those in need.
