  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected several million people since 2019. Despite various vaccines of COVID-19 protect million people in many countries, the worldwide situations of more the asymptomatic and mutated strain discovered are urging the more sensitive COVID-19 testing in this turnaround time. Unfortunately, it is still nontrivial to develop a new fast COVID-19 screening method with the easier access and lower cost, due to the technical and cost limitations of the current testing methods in the medical resource-poor districts. On the other hand, there are more and more ocular manifestations that have been reported in the COVID-19 patients as growing clinical evidence[[1][1]]. This inspired this project. We have conducted the joint clinical research since January 2021 at the ShiJiaZhuang City, Hebei province, China, which approved by the ethics committee of The fifth hospital of ShiJiaZhuang of Hebei Medical University. We undertake several blind tests of COVID-19 patients by Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Meantime as an important part of the ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test program by AIMOMICS since February 2020, we propose a new fast screening method of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras. This could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with the sustainable stable high performance in different countries and races. For this clinical trial in ShiJiaZhuang, we compare and analyze 1194 eye-region images of 115 patients, including 66 COVID-19 positive patients, 44 rehabilitation patients (nucleic acid changed from positive to negative), 5 liver patients, as well as 117 healthy people. Remarkably, we consistently achieved very high testing results (> 0.94) in terms of both sensitivity and specificity in our blind test of COVID-19 patients. This confirms the viability of the COVID-19 fast screening by the eye-region manifestations. Particularly and impressively, the results have the similar conclusion as the other clinical trials of the globally COVID-19 eye test program[[1][1]]. Hopefully, this series of ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test study, and potential rapid solution of fully self-performed COVID risk screening method, can be inspiring and helpful to more researchers in the world soon. Our model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening have the merits of the lower cost, fully self-performed, non-invasive, importantly real-time, and thus enables the continuous health surveillance. We further implement it as the open accessible APIs, and provide public service to the world. Our pilot experiments show that our model is ready to be usable to all kinds of surveillance scenarios, such as infrared temperature measurement device at airports and stations, or directly pushing to the target people groups smartphones as a packaged application.

                             The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected several million people since 2019. Despite various vaccines of COVID-19 protect million people in many countries, the worldwide situations of more the asymptomatic and mutated strain discovered are urging the more sensitive COVID-19 testing in this turnaround time. Unfortunately, it is still nontrivial to develop a new fast COVID-19 screening method with the easier access and lower cost, due to the technical and cost limitations of the current testing methods in the medical resource-poor districts. On the other hand, there are more and more ocular manifestations that have been reported in the COVID-19 patients as growing clinical evidence

                             . This inspired this project. We have conducted the joint clinical research since January 2021 at the ShiJiaZhuang City, Hebei province, China, which approved by the ethics committee of The fifth hospital of ShiJiaZhuang of Hebei Medical University. We undertake several blind tests of COVID-19 patients by Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Meantime as an important part of the ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test program by AIMOMICS since February 2020, we propose a new fast screening method of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras. This could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with the sustainable stable high performance in different countries and races. For this clinical trial in ShiJiaZhuang, we compare and analyze 1194 eye-region images of 115 patients, including 66 COVID-19 positive patients, 44 rehabilitation patients (nucleic acid changed from positive to negative), 5 liver patients, as well as 117 healthy people. Remarkably, we consistently achieved very high testing results (> 0.94) in terms of both sensitivity and specificity in our blind test of COVID-19 patients. This confirms the viability of the COVID-19 fast screening by the eye-region manifestations. Particularly and impressively, the results have the similar conclusion as the other clinical trials of the globally COVID-19 eye test program

Hopefully, this series of ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test study, and potential rapid solution of fully self-performed COVID risk screening method, can be inspiring and helpful to more researchers in the world soon. Our model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening have the merits of the lower cost, fully self-performed, non-invasive, importantly real-time, and thus enables the continuous health surveillance. We further implement it as the open accessible APIs, and provide public service to the world. Our pilot experiments show that our model is ready to be usable to all kinds of surveillance scenarios, such as infrared temperature measurement device at airports and stations, or directly pushing to the target people groups smartphones as a packaged application.

Inspired by these points, we propose a rapid COVID-19 risk screening and diagnosis model with the deep learning method based on eye-region images, captured by normal CCD or CMOS camera and cellphone. We propose the AI model with the corresponding eye images as the input to identify the COVID-19 disease. We trained the models by the data from ShiJianZhuang and Shanghai. The performance was measured at the Area Under receiver-operating-characteristic Curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and F1.

                             After more than three months of study and clinical trials, we found that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 present the consistent eye pathological symbols, including the asymptomatic. This study included 20 subjects in the pre-test dataset (train and validation) and 212 subjects in the blind test dataset. The subject-level performance of COVID-19 prescreening model in the combined study have achieved an AUC of 0.940(95% CI, 0.888-0.992), 0.990 (95% CI, 0.972-1.000) and 0.975 (95% CI, 0.940-1.000) with respect to the first, second and third blind tests.

In the past and ongoing globally registered clinical trials, we show that this model can successfully classify COVID-19 patients from healthy persons, pulmonary patients except for COVID-19 (e.g., pulmonary fungal infection, bronchopneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer), liver patients, diabetes patients and ocular patients. The experimental results reveal that patients with COVID-19 have different ocular features from others, which can be used to differentiate them from the public.

                             The convenient method of eye-region image diagnosis can help the disease control researchers to fully understand the prevalence and pathogenicity of the virus in different ages, time, region, climate, environment, occupation, and population with basic diseases, and guide effective prevention and control measures against COVID-19. Meantime, our model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening have the merits of the lower cost, fully self-performed, non-invasive, real-time results, and thus enables the continuous surveillance. We further implement it as the open accessible APIs, and provide public service to the world. Essentially, our model is also open to other form of embedding for fast screening of COVID-19, such as all kind of infrared temperature measurement device at airports and stations, or directly push to the target people groups’ smartphones as a packaged application. We believe a system implementing such an algorithm should assist the large-scale rapid large-scale screening and real-time follow-up, that can be inspiring and helpful for encouraging more researches on this topic.

                             For each participant, 3-10 photographs of the eye-region were captured by using the common CCD and CMOS cameras, assisted by doctors or healthcare workers. The same shooting plain mode and parameters were used, and avoid shooting filters. The photos were captured in a good lighting condition, and not in dark or red background. The image resolution is at least 1900×500 96dpi. The average time for taking a set of 5 eye photos is around 1 minute. In the re-examination step, all the data that cannot reveal the details of the eyes are discarded.

The model is built by the deep learning neuron networks to study the characteristics of the cropped eye regions in a latent space. Specifically, we define the subject as a set of photos taken by the same people. The classification result of the same person in might be different due to the noise in data and a proper vote strategy can enhance the robustness of the model. The results of different images of the same subject are merged by a special vote strategy. Finally, the subject-level risk assessment of COVID-19 is generated.

                             To measure the performance of the model, we define a set of metrics, such as the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Bootstrapping strategy with 1000 replicates was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals of the metrics, with an image-level resampling unit. Specifically, the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) were used to illustrate the performance in screening COVID-19 disease.

                             COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The patients usually have fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste. Nowadays, some researchers also find that Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunction is one of the common symptoms of the COVID-19. Meantime, more ocular manifestations have been reported in the COVID-19 patients as growing clinical evidence

                             Accordingly, abnormally high body temperature has been the initial and most widely used screening method for COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, the emergence and rising number of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients are posing a threat to body temperature-based screening methods. On one hand, despite the high sensitivity and good specificity of detecting the nucleic acid sequence of pathogens and amplify the signal by an amplification reaction, the long process of RT-PCR may remarkably increase the risk of infection, less ideal for epidemic control. On the other hand, conventional CT tests can show that patients with COVID-19 can have the bilateral ground-glass appearance and pulmonary turbidity, analyzed by radiologists, or deep learning algorithms, however, for some patients, CT imaging results are not obvious or even negative. Particularly, there are many other bottlenecks and difficulties for the COVID-19 diagnosis globally, such as the restriction of pharyngeal swab sampling, the lack of RT-PCR kits, the difficulties in the transportation, the preservation of samples, political factors in some country, and so on. The deep learning based model can achieve impressive performance on the eye-region images. And the heatmaps generated by deep learning model have shown that the visual features of different diseases are mainly focused on the eye region, which indicates that the model has learned the key area for disease diagnosis.

A larger multicenter study covering more patients of diverse race would be necessary to test the performance of the ocular surface feature-based deep learning system.

Consider that eye exam technology has been used to screen a variety of diseases, such as diabetes and kidney disease.

Different from previous studies, which utilize RT-PCR or CT imaging, the input of our system is the face image or binocular image captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras. Combining with the development of deep learning, it enables the real-time COVID-19 screening from two aspects, sample acquisition, and testing.
