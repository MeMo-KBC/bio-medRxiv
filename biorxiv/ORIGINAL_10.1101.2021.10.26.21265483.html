  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Aerosol transport of enteric microbiota including fecal pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) has been documented in a range of settings but remains poorly understood outside indoor environments. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to summarize evidence on specific enteric microbiota including enteric pathogens and ARGs that have been measured in aerosol samples in urban settings where the risks of outdoor exposure and antibiotic resistance (AR) spread may be highest. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a key word search for articles published within the years 1990-2020 using relevant data sources.

To be included, studies contained extractable data on enteric microbes and AR in outdoor aerosols regardless of source confirmation and reported on qualitative, quantitative, or viability data on enteric microbes or AR. Qualitative analyses and metric summaries revealed that enteric microbes and AR have been consistently reported in outdoor aerosols, generally via relative abundance measures, though gaps remain preventing full understanding of the role of the aeromicrobiological pathway in the fate and transport of enteric associated outdoor aerosols. We identified remaining gaps in the evidence base including a need for broad characterization of enteric pathogens in bioaerosols beyond bacterial genera, a need for greater sampling in locations of high enteric disease risk, and a need for quantitative estimation of microbial and nucleic acid densities that may be applied to fate and transport models and in quantitative microbial risk assessment.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Aerosol transport of enteric microbiota including fecal pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) has been documented in a range of settings but remains poorly understood outside indoor environments. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to summarize evidence on specific enteric microbiota including enteric pathogens and ARGs that have been measured in aerosol samples in urban settings where the risks of outdoor exposure and antibiotic resistance (AR) spread may be highest. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a key word search for articles published within the years 1990-2020 using relevant data sources. Two authors independently conducted the keyword searches of databases and conducted primary and secondary screenings before merging results. To be included, studies contained extractable data on enteric microbes and AR in outdoor aerosols regardless of source confirmation and reported on qualitative, quantitative, or viability data on enteric microbes or AR. Qualitative analyses and metric summaries revealed that enteric microbes and AR have been consistently reported in outdoor aerosols, generally via relative abundance measures, though gaps remain preventing full understanding of the role of the aeromicrobiological pathway in the fate and transport of enteric associated outdoor aerosols. We identified remaining gaps in the evidence base including a need for broad characterization of enteric pathogens in bioaerosols beyond bacterial genera, a need for greater sampling in locations of high enteric disease risk, and a need for quantitative estimation of microbial and nucleic acid densities that may be applied to fate and transport models and in quantitative microbial risk assessment.

                             Aerosol transport of enteric microbiota including fecal pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) has been documented in a range of settings but remains poorly understood outside indoor environments. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to summarize evidence on specific enteric microbiota including enteric pathogens and ARGs that have been measured in aerosol samples in urban settings where the risks of outdoor exposure and antibiotic resistance (AR) spread may be highest. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a key word search for articles published within the years 1990-2020 using relevant data sources. Two authors independently conducted the keyword searches of databases and conducted primary and secondary screenings before merging results. To be included, studies contained extractable data on enteric microbes and AR in outdoor aerosols regardless of source confirmation and reported on qualitative, quantitative, or viability data on enteric microbes or AR. Qualitative analyses and metric summaries revealed that enteric microbes and AR have been consistently reported in outdoor aerosols, generally via relative abundance measures, though gaps remain preventing full understanding of the role of the aeromicrobiological pathway in the fate and transport of enteric associated outdoor aerosols. We identified remaining gaps in the evidence base including a need for broad characterization of enteric pathogens in bioaerosols beyond bacterial genera, a need for greater sampling in locations of high enteric disease risk, and a need for quantitative estimation of microbial and nucleic acid densities that may be applied to fate and transport models and in quantitative microbial risk assessment.

                             Studies in high-risk outdoor settings in the USA and in other high-income countries have revealed that bioaerosols containing enteric (intestinal) microbes are common where concentrated human or animal fecal waste and one or more mechanisms for aerosolization co-occur. Presence of enteric microbes in aerosols has been best characterized in ambient air surrounding specific point and area sources such as wastewater treatment plants

                             . Establishing and maintaining effective and sustainable infrastructure to improve population health in cities is becoming increasingly difficult due to factors including accelerating urbanization and densification, climate change and its effects on infrastructure, and financing constraints; these and other limiting factors are most acute in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Information on ambient fluxes of enteric pathogens and AR in cities lacking good waste management is needed, targeting settings with potentially elevated exposure risks and AR spread. Cities in high-income countries (HICs) are not generally considered high risk for exposure to enteric pathogens via sanitary deficits: human excreta is typically directed into covered or underground wastewater infrastructure, creating a separation between humans and their waste to interrupt transmission of enteric infections via well understood pathways.

Searches were in the form of a one line string that included all fields from the scope (e.g., aerosol, extramural, urban…), pathogens (e.g., enteric, fecal indicator, adenovirus…), exposures (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, viable…), mechanisms (e.g., aerosolization, bubbles, aeration…), sampling methods (e.g., impaction, impinger, filter…), AR associated (e.g., intI1, tetA, qnrB…), and antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, multidrug resistance…). Search strings used “or” and “and” statements to include multiple fields such as “fecal indicator bacteria OR FIB” AND “bioaerosol OR ambient OR air OR aerosol OR airborne”. The full search string is detailed in Supplemental Material.

                              Two authors independently conducted the keyword searches in each database and compiled findings in Zotero (Version 5·0·96). After deduplication of search results, the authors each conducted an initial screening based on titles and abstracts of papers. Papers passed the initial screening if the title or abstract suggested relevance to the keywords in the search. The full text of papers that passed initial screening were reviewed independently by the two authors if papers were: (1) published in English; (2) published from the 1990-2020; and (3) published or accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, refereed conference proceedings, government or multilateral document, thesis or dissertation, book, or other document appearing on indexed databases we identified; (4) contained extractable data on enteric microbes including pathogens and AR in outdoor bioaerosols; (5) contained data on targets that could be related to no source, a specific point source, or an area source but must have been from an urban site; and (6) reported on qualitative (presence/absence), quantitative (culture or PCR-based), or viability (culture) data that was sufficient for interpretation within the three aforementioned groups.

                              After independent searches, we consulted and compared our findings to achieve consensus on inclusion. For any dissent on inclusion of a paper, a third party was consulted for discussion before again reaching a consensus decision on inclusion. Backward searches examined the references, authors and contributors, and keywords identified in the literature resulting from the initial keyword searches. Forward searches examined articles not initially identified that have referenced literature resulting from the initial keyword searches.

                              For each study, data were extracted and recorded; the full compilation is included in Supplemental Material. We recorded document identifiers such as authors, publication year, document type, and whether the document was found through initial, backward, or forward searches. We categorized documents meeting inclusion criteria first by subject, either AR or enteric microbes detection. Some publications reported both. We then categorized these by analysis method: culture, PCR, or sequencing.

Depending on the category, we recorded qualitative, quantitative, and semi- quantitative data, indicating relevant targets and results within the scope of our review. A formal meta- analysis of the disparate findings was not deemed possible given the limited evidence on this topic and the wide diversity of methods employed in measurement in this emerging area. Therefore, we synthesized review data through categorization and descriptive summary, a common approach when quantitative meta-analysis is not possible,

                              Bioaerosol sampling can typically be categorized by three different methods: filtration, impaction, and impingement. In our review, the majority of studies employed filtration to collect bioaerosol samples (n=60 studies). Filtration was followed by active impaction (n=28), impingement (n=10), and passive impaction via gravitational settling (n=8). Some studies used multiple methods, often when performing culture-dependent analyses in addition to culture-independent analyses.

                             Results of this systematic review suggest that fecal signatures are present in ambient urban air across the globe, along with evidence suggesting aerosols may play a role in urban AR spread. Notably, studies conducted in cities in LMICs show a broad and diverse range of airborne microbial gene targets of possibly human fecal origin, potentially related to sanitation infrastructure deficits

                             . However, the results also reveal large gaps in the characterization and detection of important enteric microbes and AR in bioaerosols in ambient urban air. An especially concerning gap is that LMICs make up a minority of all study locations within the scope of this review, despite the fact that cities in these countries may be characterized by inadequate sanitation infrastructure and high population density, leading to widespread fecal contamination and disproportionately bearing the global burden of diarrheal disease, the cause of 1·8 million deaths worldwide in 2017.

                             Given widespread carriage and shedding of important enteric pathogens, poor containment of sanitary waste near population centers, and the limited evidence that enteric pathogen- associated nucleic acids are widely present in aerosols, these sites should be an explicit focus of future monitoring efforts to understand the extent and implications of fecal microbe transport in aerosols.

                             Studies that do assess enteric microbes and AR are dominated by quantal (presence/absence) or semi- quantitative data obtained through sequencing. Such estimates target abundance in terms of the microbial community within each sample, as opposed to the environment in which the communities exist. While sequencing is useful in broadly characterizing and understanding infectious diseases and microbial communities in general, it is less useful in the context of transport phenomena and exposure measurements without additional contextual data, typically quantitative measurements that report density of specific genes or microbes per unit volume or mass.

First, though we used a double-blind search strategy and agreed a priori on inclusion criteria and other methods, bias or human error may have introduced some inconsistency in including literature for the review. Though we used a consensus-based approach to inclusion of studies, we may have missed or mischaracterized individual studies given the large number of papers we reviewed. Second, we excluded studies that were not translatable to English or that had non-extractable data that may have been valuable contributions within this scope of work. Third, because of the broad range of analysis methods, diagnostic tools, and variability in interpretation of data, we did not perform a structured meta-analysis and limited our results and discussion to a broad characterization and categorization of the literature. Future reviews of an expanded number of papers may be able to quantitatively synthesize and compare study findings according to methods and metadata using robust statistical methods well suited to meta-analysis.

                             Based on our interpretation of the results of this review, we can offer the following conclusions. First, enteric microbes and AR are widely detected in outdoor urban aerosols. A wide range of targets have been detected, though bacteria are most prominent; most analytical methods in the studies covered in this review employed methods that limited detection to bacteria only. Further attention on specific pathogens of interest and especially studies targeting enteric viruses and protozoa are needed. Second, we observe major gaps in evidence around microbial viability and quantitative estimation of specific enteric pathogens of global risk relevance. Quantitative data are needed alongside aerosol size data to advance fate and transport modeling, and viability of pathogens – even if indirect via bacterial indicator co-culture – is critically important to any assessment of the public health relevance of pathogen detection in aerosols. Third, we can conclude that important gaps in evidence are apparent specifically in settings where the risks of enteric pathogen exposure and AR emergence and spread are most acute: cities of LMICs, which are characterized in part by poor sanitation and high population density in close proximity to potential sources of bioaerosols containing enteric targets. We propose that future studies should address these gaps so that we will be able to better understand the potential for enteric microbes and AR in aerosols to impact global public health and to inform control strategies that can limit exposures when and where they are most critical.
