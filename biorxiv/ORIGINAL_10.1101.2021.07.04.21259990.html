  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Despite recommendations regarding prompt treatment of cases and enhanced hygiene measures, scarlet fever outbreaks increased in England between 2014-2018. We aimed to assess the impact of standard interventions on transmission of Streptococcus pyogenes to classroom contacts, households, and classroom environments.

Methods We undertook a prospective, contact tracing study in schools with 2 consecutive scarlet fever cases that were reported to local Health Protection teams in London between March 1st and May 31st in 2018 and 2019. We cultured throat swabs from cases, household contacts, and classroom contacts at four time points. We also cultured hand swabs and cough plates from all cases, and from classroom contacts in 2019. Surface swabs from toys and other fomites in classrooms were cultured in 2018, and settle plates from classrooms were collected in 2019. Any sample with S. pyogenes detected was recorded as positive and underwent emm genotyping and genome sequencing to compare with the outbreak strain.

Findings Six classes, comprising 12 scarlet fever cases, 17 household contacts, and 278 classroom contacts were recruited from March 1st to May 31st in 2018 and the same period in 2019. Prevalence of the outbreak S. pyogenes strain in throat swabs from asymptomatic classroom contacts was high, increasing from 9.6% (11/115) in week 1, to 26.9% (34/126) in week 2, to 24.1% (26/108) in week 3, then 14.3% (5/35) in week 4. Colonisation with non-outbreak and non-genotyped S. pyogenes strains was 1.7% (2/115); 3.9% (5/126); 5.6% (6/108); and 0/35 in the same weeks. Genome sequencing showed clonality of isolates within each of six classes, confirming recent transmission accounted for high carriage. When transmissibility was tested, children who were asymptomatic carriers of emm 4 and emm 3.93 had positive cough plates on 1/14 (7.1%) and 7/21 (33.3%) occasions respectively. Only 1/60 surface swabs taken in 3 classrooms yielded the outbreak S. pyogenes strain. In contrast, 2/12 and 6/12 settle plates placed in elevated locations yielded the outbreak S. pyogenes strain in the two classrooms tested.

Interpretation S. pyogenes transmission in schools is intense and may occur prior to, or inspite of reported treatment of cases, underlining a need for rapid case management. Despite guideline adherence, heavy shedding of S. pyogenes by small numbers of classroom contacts may perpetuate outbreaks, and airborne transmission has a plausible role in spread. The findings highlight the need for research to improve understanding and assess effectiveness of interventions to reduce S. pyogenes airborne transmission.

Methods We undertook a prospective, contact tracing study in schools with 2 consecutive scarlet fever cases that were reported to local Health Protection teams in London between March 1st and May 31st in 2018 and 2019. We cultured throat swabs from cases, household contacts, and classroom contacts at four time points. We also cultured hand swabs and cough plates from all cases, and from classroom contacts in 2019. Surface swabs from toys and other fomites in classrooms were cultured in 2018, and settle plates from classrooms were collected in 2019. Any sample with S. pyogenes detected was recorded as positive and underwent emm genotyping and genome sequencing to compare with the outbreak strain.

Findings Six classes, comprising 12 scarlet fever cases, 17 household contacts, and 278 classroom contacts were recruited from March 1st to May 31st in 2018 and the same period in 2019. Prevalence of the outbreak S. pyogenes strain in throat swabs from asymptomatic classroom contacts was high, increasing from 9.6% (11/115) in week 1, to 26.9% (34/126) in week 2, to 24.1% (26/108) in week 3, then 14.3% (5/35) in week 4. Colonisation with non-outbreak and non-genotyped S. pyogenes strains was 1.7% (2/115); 3.9% (5/126); 5.6% (6/108); and 0/35 in the same weeks. Genome sequencing showed clonality of isolates within each of six classes, confirming recent transmission accounted for high carriage. When transmissibility was tested, children who were asymptomatic carriers of emm 4 and emm 3.93 had positive cough plates on 1/14 (7.1%) and 7/21 (33.3%) occasions respectively. Only 1/60 surface swabs taken in 3 classrooms yielded the outbreak S. pyogenes strain. In contrast, 2/12 and 6/12 settle plates placed in elevated locations yielded the outbreak S. pyogenes strain in the two classrooms tested.

Interpretation S. pyogenes transmission in schools is intense and may occur prior to, or inspite of reported treatment of cases, underlining a need for rapid case management. Despite guideline adherence, heavy shedding of S. pyogenes by small numbers of classroom contacts may perpetuate outbreaks, and airborne transmission has a plausible role in spread. The findings highlight the need for research to improve understanding and assess effectiveness of interventions to reduce S. pyogenes airborne transmission.

                              Despite recommendations regarding prompt treatment of cases and enhanced hygiene measures, scarlet fever outbreaks increased in England between 2014-2018. We aimed to assess the impact of standard interventions on transmission of Streptococcus pyogenes to classroom contacts, households, and classroom environments.

                              We undertook a prospective, contact tracing study in schools with 2 consecutive scarlet fever cases that were reported to local Health Protection teams in London between March 1

                              and May 31st in 2018 and 2019. We cultured throat swabs from cases, household contacts, and classroom contacts at four time points. We also cultured hand swabs and cough plates from all cases, and from classroom contacts in 2019. Surface swabs from toys and other fomites in classrooms were cultured in 2018, and settle plates from classrooms were collected in 2019. Any sample with S. pyogenes detected was recorded as positive and underwent emm genotyping and genome sequencing to compare with the outbreak strain.

                              Six classes, comprising 12 scarlet fever cases, 17 household contacts, and 278 classroom contacts were recruited from March 1

                              to May 31st in 2018 and the same period in 2019. Prevalence of the outbreak S. pyogenes strain in throat swabs from asymptomatic classroom contacts was high, increasing from 9.6% (11/115) in week 1, to 26.9% (34/126) in week 2, to 24.1% (26/108) in week 3, then 14.3% (5/35) in week 4. Colonisation with non-outbreak and non-genotyped S. pyogenes strains was 1.7% (2/115); 3.9% (5/126); 5.6% (6/108); and 0/35 in the same weeks. Genome sequencing showed clonality of isolates within each of six classes, confirming recent transmission accounted for high carriage. When transmissibility was tested, children who were asymptomatic carriers of emm4 and emm3.93 had positive cough plates on 1/14 (7.1%) and 7/21 (33.3%) occasions respectively. Only 1/60 surface swabs taken in 3 classrooms yielded the outbreak S. pyogenes strain. In contrast, 2/12 and 6/12 settle plates placed in elevated locations yielded the outbreak S. pyogenes strain in the two classrooms tested.

                              S. pyogenes transmission in schools is intense and may occur prior to, or inspite of reported treatment of cases, underlining a need for rapid case management. Despite guideline adherence, heavy shedding of S. pyogenes by small numbers of classroom contacts may perpetuate outbreaks, and airborne transmission has a plausible role in spread. The findings highlight the need for research to improve understanding and assess effectiveness of interventions to reduce S. pyogenes airborne transmission.

Over 30,000 cases were notified in 2018, the highest number since 1960, with an age-specific incidence of 523 per 100,000 among 1-4 year olds in England and Wales (

                             ). Guidance for management of school/nursery outbreaks of scarlet fever emphasises the importance of maintaining good hand hygiene, prompt antibiotic treatment of index cases, and exclusion from school until 24h after antibiotic treatment has started (

                             ). Escalation of interventions including daily cleaning of toys, utensils, and frequent touch points is recommended if necessary, along with daily vacuuming of soft furnishings (

                             To understand why outbreaks might continue to occur despite following these interventions, we investigated S. pyogenes transmission during the scarlet fever seasons of 2018 and 2019, focussing on educational settings with two sequential notifications of scarlet fever. Our primary aim was to determine if existing guidance that focuses on hygiene, alongside case exclusion, prevented transmission of S. pyogenes in the classroom. Our secondary aim was to investigate modes of transmission, to inform future guidance and provide insight into S. pyogenes outbreaks more generally.

                             Whole genome sequencing was undertaken on all viable S. pyogenes isolates identified. Within each setting, isolates of the same genotype were clonal, with individual strains being a median of 0 SNPs (range 0-5 SNPs) different to other strains in that setting, consistent with a common source of transmission, but a median of 12 SNPs (range 4-55 SNPs) different from the closest strain of the same genotype sequenced in 2014.

                             To determine the source of ongoing transmission in the classrooms, the protocol was amended in year 2 to include hand-swabs and cough-plates from classroom contacts in addition to throat swabs, while settle plates were used to sample air in the classroom. In setting 4, where emm4 predominated, one of four children carrying S. pyogenes was cough-plate positive in the second week, but not in subsequent weeks (appendix p6); all isolates in this setting were 0 SNP apart (appendix p17). Cough-plates were negative in setting 5 (also emm4 where again isolates were 0 SNP apart; appendix p6, p17). Overall 1/14 (7.1%) emm4 positive throat swabs was associated with a positive cough plate. In setting 6, where emm3.93 S. pyogenes predominated, cough-plates were positive for the outbreak emm3.93 strain in one third of children with positive emm3.93 throat swabs (week 1, 2/6; week 2, 3/9, week 3, 2/6) (

It was only possible to incorporate a 4-week gap for settings 5 and 6 for logistic reasons related to the timing of the school term. In setting 5, carriage of the outbreak emm4 strain remained steady throughout the study, with a prevalence of 0% (0/17), 13.6% (3/22), 13.6% (3/22) in weeks 1-3 respectively and 12.5% (3/23) at week 7.

Notably in this outbreak, throat swabs from two of the cases and a single household contact were positive in week 3, emm3.93 (Appendix p4-5). To determine the likelihood that culture-based sampling might be insensitive, DNA extracted from culture-negative swabs from setting 6 was subject to S. pyogenes ProS PCR; 50/65 (76.9%) culture negative swabs were deemed qPCR negative.

                             This prospective contact tracing study of S. pyogenes transmission was undertaken in response to an unprecedented rise in scarlet fever notifications in England. Using genome sequencing to confirm common sources of transmission, we found a high prevalence of the outbreak strain among asymptomatic classroom contacts, peaking in the second week of our investigations. Despite antibiotic treatment and isolation of index cases for 24h after initiation of antibiotic treatment, and implementation of standard hygiene measures within the classrooms, transmission within the class was observed. Enhanced sampling in year 2 revealed evidence of prominent S. pyogenes shedding by some children, and airborne dispersal of genomically identical strains in the classroom.

                             Current public health guidance on scarlet fever management focusses on treatment, exclusion, and hygiene interventions, with escalation to include daily cleaning of surfaces (

                             ). Although contamination of fomites including toys is no doubt important, we found that transmission was ongoing despite such cleaning and in the absence of frequent surface S. pyogenes contamination. Indeed, the main source of S. pyogenes appeared to be the children themselves. Other than foodborne scarlet fever outbreaks (

                             ), there are remarkably few recent investigations that examine transmission routes. Four contemporary reports describe scarlet fever outbreaks with high attack rates (23-72%) in educational settings that were not controlled by standard interventions (

Microbiological detection of S. pyogenes to enable treatment of children found to be colonised would however be challenging to undertake routinely for all scarlet fever outbreaks. Our study underlines a need for research to evaluate a potential role for molecular point of care tests for rapid detection of colonisation and outbreak management.

                             By week 3, prevalence of the genomically-confirmed outbreak strain was 14%-47% across all six settings, while carriage of non-outbreak strains was infrequent. Carriage rates detected are remarkably similar to data from higher attack rate outbreaks (

                             ). Our study draws attention to the importance of context when measuring S. pyogenes carriage rates as, outside of the springtime outbreak season, asymptomatic carriage in healthy children in England is estimated at <6% (

                             We frequently recovered the outbreak strain among classroom contacts in week 1 of sampling, indicating that transmission had already occurred in the classroom, whether from one of the index cases of scarlet fever or another unknown source. It is possible that treatment may have been delayed in some cases; a recent study identified one fifth of scarlet fever cases to be initially diagnosed as a viral infection, allowing transmission to continue if the affected child remains in school, untreated (
                             <a id="xref-ref-24-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-24">

                             It is generally believed that asymptomatic carriage is unlikely to lead to transmission, although the term ‘carrier’ is more often used to refer to a case that has been treated for S. pyogenes pharyngitis but demonstrates microbiological failure (

                             ). In our study, the systematic increase in prevalence of outbreak strains between weeks 1 and 2 in classroom contacts pointed to ongoing transmission from asymptomatic carriers, despite index cases having been excluded and treated. Indeed, after returning to school, four cases re-acquired the outbreak strain by week 3, presumably through contact with other colonised contacts or classroom air, although did not develop symptomatic illness; these cases re-acquired emm1 (M1

Our investigations using cough plates and hand swabs demonstrated that at least one third of asymptomatic emm3.93 carriers were shedding more S. pyogenes than other children in exhaled cough and on hands. These findings raise a question about the definition of colonisation and infection in young children, who may not be able to identify their symptoms, or may be infectious without symptoms. The study confirms the existence of so-called heavy shedders among those who are apparently asymptomatic at the time of sampling and resonates with historic reports of heavy nasal shedding by S. pyogenes nasal carriers (

                             Settle plates placed in elevated locations for just 2-3 hours, provided evidence of S. pyogenes dispersal in classroom air in settings 5 and 6; the timing of settle plate positivity coincided with more intense periods of asymptomatic shedding. Settle plates provide an easy read out in an outbreak setting and could be used to indicate a need for improved ventilation, social distancing, or surveillance for heavy shedders. Airborne spread of scarlet fever-causing streptococci was previously recognised as a threat in hospitals in the 1930’s and in military barracks in the 1940’s (

                             ). Contemporary outbreaks of S. pyogenes that are not explained by direct contact alone suggest a need to take not only indirect contact but also airborne transmission into consideration when developing guidelines.

                             The scarlet fever outbreak setting has provided an unexpected model for understanding S. pyogenes transmission and immunity. Children of the same age were exposed to a presumed similar inoculum of S. pyogenes in class, yet only ∼5% developed scarlet fever, some of whom re-acquired the outbreak strain without illness three weeks later, while some anecdotally developed pharyngitis. Others were found to asymptomatically shed S. pyogenes for several weeks, while others showed transient colonisation, or no infection whatsoever. Our understanding of immunity to S. pyogenes is heavily dominated by factors that influence susceptibility to invasive disease. The findings highlight a gap in our knowledge regarding mucosal immunity to S. pyogenes, specifically whether full immunity requires antibodies to prevent streptococcal adherence, promote bacterial clearance, and inhibit streptococcal virulence factors during pharyngitis. This is potentially critical to vaccine development. Coupled with differences in genetic susceptibility and oral microbiota, differing layers of immunity could go some way to explain why children express a range of disease phenotypes.

                             There are limitations to our study. Sampling of fomites was limited to single timepoints in year 1, while settle plates to sample air were only used in year 2, restricting ability to determine the relative importance of each transmission route. Our study was based in London, so findings may not be relevant to rural, or low- and middle-income settings, or regions with different climate. Furthermore, transmission intensity may be seasonal; we attempted to sample outside of the main scarlet fever season, but schools were unwilling to participate. Indeed, engagement was high when anxiety about scarlet fever was greatest.

                             The study has demonstrated that heavy asymptomatic shedding by a proportion of children may account for persistence of S. pyogenes outbreaks in classroom settings. The phenomenon of super-shedders and super-spreaders is increasingly recognised as a source of heterogeneity in infectious disease modelling (

                             ) and is consistent with the explosive nature of some streptococcal outbreaks. Relevance to other respiratory infections is unclear. Our findings may explain the periodic failure of interventions focussed on hygiene alone to curtail outbreaks of S. pyogenes, both in the classroom and other institutional settings. The recognition of heavy asymptomatic shedding highlights a potential role for social distancing, improved respiratory hygiene, and better ventilation in reducing S. pyogenes transmission during outbreaks. As an unforeseen consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of these measures has proven highly successful in halting England’s scarlet fever upsurge, at least in 2020 (

                             ), highlighting a need for better understanding of transmission routes in preventing future upsurges.
