  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Objectives To evaluate the benefit of combining polygenic risk scores (PRS) with the QCancer-10 (colorectal cancer) non-genetic risk prediction model to identify those at highest risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).

Design Population based cohort study. Six different PRS for CRC were developed (using LDpred2 PRS software, clumping and thresholding approaches, and genome-wide significant models). The top-performing genome-wide and GWAS-significant PRS were then combined with QCancer-10 and performance compared to QCancer-10 alone. Case-control (logistic regression) and time-to-event (Cox proportional hazards) analyses were used to evaluate risk model performance in men and women.

Setting and participants UK Biobank Study. A total of 434587 individuals with complete genetic and QCancer-10 predictor data were included in the QCancer-10+PRS modelling cohorts.

Main outcome measures Prediction of colorectal cancer diagnosis by genetic, non-genetic and combined risk models.

Findings PRS derived using the LDpred2 program performed best, with an odds-ratio per standard deviation of 1.58, and top age- and sex-adjusted C-statistic of 0.733 (95% confidence interval 0.710 to 0.753) in logistic regression models in the validation cohort. Integrated QCancer-10+PRS models out-performed QCancer-10 alone. In men, the integrated LDpred2 (QCancer-10+LDP) model produced a C-statistic of 0.730 (0.720 to 0.741) and explained variation of 28.1% (26.3% to 30.0%), compared with 0.693 (0.682 to 0.704) and 21.0% (18.9% to 23.1%) for QCancer-10 alone. Performance improvements in women were similar. In the top 20% of individuals at highest absolute risk, the sensitivity of QCancer-10+LDP models for predicting CRC diagnosis within 5 years was 47.6% in men and 42.5% in women, with respective 3.49-fold and 2.75-fold absolute increases in the top 5% of risk compared to average. Decision curve analysis showed that adding PRS to QCancer-10 improved net-benefit and interventions avoided, across most probability thresholds.

Conclusions Integrating PRS with QCancer-10 significantly improves risk prediction over QCancer-10 alone. Evaluation of risk stratified population screening using this approach is warranted.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Objectives To evaluate the benefit of combining polygenic risk scores (PRS) with the QCancer-10 (colorectal cancer) non-genetic risk prediction model to identify those at highest risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).

Design Population based cohort study. Six different PRS for CRC were developed (using LDpred2 PRS software, clumping and thresholding approaches, and genome-wide significant models). The top-performing genome-wide and GWAS-significant PRS were then combined with QCancer-10 and performance compared to QCancer-10 alone. Case-control (logistic regression) and time-to-event (Cox proportional hazards) analyses were used to evaluate risk model performance in men and women.

Setting and participants UK Biobank Study. A total of 434587 individuals with complete genetic and QCancer-10 predictor data were included in the QCancer-10+PRS modelling cohorts.

Main outcome measures Prediction of colorectal cancer diagnosis by genetic, non-genetic and combined risk models.

Findings PRS derived using the LDpred2 program performed best, with an odds-ratio per standard deviation of 1.58, and top age- and sex-adjusted C-statistic of 0.733 (95% confidence interval 0.710 to 0.753) in logistic regression models in the validation cohort. Integrated QCancer-10+PRS models out-performed QCancer-10 alone. In men, the integrated LDpred2 (QCancer-10+LDP) model produced a C-statistic of 0.730 (0.720 to 0.741) and explained variation of 28.1% (26.3% to 30.0%), compared with 0.693 (0.682 to 0.704) and 21.0% (18.9% to 23.1%) for QCancer-10 alone. Performance improvements in women were similar. In the top 20% of individuals at highest absolute risk, the sensitivity of QCancer-10+LDP models for predicting CRC diagnosis within 5 years was 47.6% in men and 42.5% in women, with respective 3.49-fold and 2.75-fold absolute increases in the top 5% of risk compared to average. Decision curve analysis showed that adding PRS to QCancer-10 improved net-benefit and interventions avoided, across most probability thresholds.

Conclusions Integrating PRS with QCancer-10 significantly improves risk prediction over QCancer-10 alone. Evaluation of risk stratified population screening using this approach is warranted.

                              Population based cohort study. Six different PRS for CRC were developed (using LDpred2 PRS software, clumping and thresholding approaches, and genome-wide significant models). The top-performing genome-wide and GWAS-significant PRS were then combined with QCancer-10 and performance compared to QCancer-10 alone. Case-control (logistic regression) and time-to-event (Cox proportional hazards) analyses were used to evaluate risk model performance in men and women.

                              PRS derived using the LDpred2 program performed best, with an odds-ratio per standard deviation of 1.58, and top age- and sex-adjusted C-statistic of 0.733 (95% confidence interval 0.710 to 0.753) in logistic regression models in the validation cohort. Integrated QCancer-10+PRS models out-performed QCancer-10 alone. In men, the integrated LDpred2 (QCancer-10+LDP) model produced a C-statistic of 0.730 (0.720 to 0.741) and explained variation of 28.1% (26.3% to 30.0%), compared with 0.693 (0.682 to 0.704) and 21.0% (18.9% to 23.1%) for QCancer-10 alone. Performance improvements in women were similar. In the top 20% of individuals at highest absolute risk, the sensitivity of QCancer-10+LDP models for predicting CRC diagnosis within 5 years was 47.6% in men and 42.5% in women, with respective 3.49-fold and 2.75-fold absolute increases in the top 5% of risk compared to average. Decision curve analysis showed that adding PRS to QCancer-10 improved net-benefit and interventions avoided, across most probability thresholds.

                              Integrating PRS with QCancer-10 significantly improves risk prediction over QCancer-10 alone. Evaluation of risk stratified population screening using this approach is warranted.

                             Population screening is effective in reducing CRC incidence and mortality, through detection and removal of pre-malignant adenomas, and earlier detection of cancers. Screening modalities vary internationally. While colonoscopy is the gold-standard, it is expensive, invasive and time consuming. Many countries have adopted a staged process, with initial faecal blood testing, followed by colonoscopy for those who test positive. Risk-stratified approaches to screening direct resources to those at highest risk, have the potential to improve screening detection rates, reduce investigative burden of those at lower risk, and potentially improve cost-effectiveness.

As the predictors are derived from electronic health records, it could be embedded at point of care, and linked with screening records to facilitate risk stratification within the bowel screening programme.

                             Genetic variants known to predispose to CRC are mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified as significant in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Genetic risk can be summarised in a polygenic risk score (PRS). Most existing PRS have used a limited set (typically tens) of risk SNPs that have achieved formal statistical significance in GWAS, with genotypes weighted by predicted effect sizes.

                             More recently, “genome-wide PRS” have incorporated many more SNPs than those reaching GWAS-significance, based on the notion that many true risk SNPs remain unidentified. These models have generally produced better performance than “GWAS-significant” models, but evaluation in CRC has been limited.

                             We hypothesised that integrating PRS with QCancer-10 would provide enhanced risk prediction, and that genome-wide PRS would give greatest benefit. We used UKB to develop and compare PRS using several genome-wide and GWAS-significant approaches, minimising overfitting and optimism by using summary data which did not overlap with the UKB dataset. We validated PRS performance in Geographic and Minority Ethnic Validation Cohorts. We then derived integrated QCancer-10+PRS risk models, using the top-performing genome-wide PRS and the GWAS-significant PRS, which we internally validated and compared with QCancer-10.

Inspection of Schoenfeld residuals showed that the proportional hazard assumption held. We evaluated the use of multiple fractional polynomials to model the predictors, ultimately using a fractional polynomial term to model the genome-wide PRS in the model for females. We assessed for possible interactions between the predictors by visual inspection of plots of marginal effects of the QCancer-10 risk score across PRS values, and examining the prognostic strength and significance of interaction terms based on Wald χ

                              Model sensitivities were evaluated by calculating the proportion of cases identified at centile thresholds for absolute risk and relative risk. Relative risks were calculated relative to an individual of the same age and sex, mean PRS (by sex), mean PCs, BMI of 25, white ethnicity, mean Townsend score, and no other CRC risk factors. We used decision curve analyses to compare the net benefit and interventions avoided using QCancer-10 and QCancer-10+PRS models. For decision curve and subgroup analyses, QCancer-10+PRS models were first adjusted for optimism, and recalibrated QCancer-10 models were used.

We found evidence of an interaction between QCancer-10 and the GWAS-significant PRS in men (P interaction = 0.004), with reduced effect of QCancer-10 score at higher PRS, but did not ultimately include this in the model given the relative weakness of the interaction (Table S12, Figure S18).

As with QCancer-10, in those with a first degree family history of CRC, female QCancer-10+PRS models tended to over-predict risk, particularly in higher risk groups; male QCancer-10+PRS models were well calibrated (Table S11, Figure S17). In minority ethnicities, QCancer-10+PRS models underpredicted risk (Table S11) to a greater extent than QCancer-10, subject to the caveat of a low CRC case numbers (46 men, 58 in women) in this subgroup.

QCancer-10 and QCancer-10+GWS had lower sensitivity than QCancer-10+LDP (Tables S13-S16).

                             We have undertaken the first study to develop and validate new prediction models for colorectal cancer that combine phenotypic risk with genome-wide PRS. We show that combining the non-genetic QCancer-10 model with either genome-wide or GWAS-significant PRS significantly improves model performance and clinical benefit, with greatest improvements seen in the QCancer-10+LDP model. The QCancer-10+LDP models have higher discrimination in UKB than any previously published CRC risk score.

                             Our QCancer-10+PRS risk models would provide more accurate risk information for patients and healthcare professionals on which to base screening decisions. Our study predicts that QCancer-10+PRS models have a greater net-benefit and avoid more interventions than QCancer-10 across a wide range of clinically-relevant risk thresholds, with the greatest benefit from QCancer-10+LDP. The sensitivities achieved using QCancer-10+PRS exceed those of other integrated models recently validated in UKBioank.

                             The genome-wide SNP genotyping required for LDpred2 is reliably performed from saliva samples, and is rapid, inexpensive and straightforward to analyse. The sensitivities and decision curves provided by QCancer-10+LDP could therefore be used to inform clinical decision making.

                             Of the PRS method evaluated, LDpred2-grid and LDpred2-grid-sp models had highest discrimination, explained more of the variation in risk, and were well calibrated. The improvement in performance between the derivation and validation cohorts when using the PRS models probably r esults from lower genetic homogeneity in the latter. Evaluation of the PRS in a geographically external cohort demonstrates portability of the models. The Geographic Validation Cohort was well matched in age to the derivation cohort, but had a higher proportion of women; prevalence of CRC was higher, at 1.79% compared to 1.51% in the derivation cohort. We would expect performance in Northern European individuals in the general population to be similar to that of the Validation Cohort.

                             We used expected genotype dosages rather than allele counts in each PRS, incorporating uncertainty in genotype imputation, and applied correction for ascertainment bias to effect sizes in the GWAS-significant model.

                             UKB provides a large sample size, extensive phenotyping, completeness of data recording, and linkage to external datasets. Linkage to cancer registry data in UKB ended in 2015/16 at the time of our study, so we have only been able to follow-up for a median 7 years; updating this will improve risk estimates and permit estimation of risks over a longer follow-up. The UKB age range of ∼40-70 is similar to that of bowel cancer screening (50 to 74 in England and Scotland), but narrower than 25 to 84 used in the original Qcancer-10 study.

                             However, model performance in UKB is arguably unlikely to reflect relative performance in the general population, for several reasons. Model performance will vary between populations with different prevalence or risk of a disease – known as the ‘spectrum effect’. As UKB has a lower incidence of disease than the general population of screening age, one might expect sensitivity to increase (which is of benefit in a screening test) when applied to a population with higher risk.

                             Furthermore, all of our models appeared to perform less well in females. For PRS, wide confidence intervals in the Geographic Validation Cohort mean this finding should be interpreted with caution, but for models that include QCancer-10, this difference was not unexpected. The known healthy volunteer bias that exists in UKB is especially marked in women (for example, the reduction in all-cause mortality and overall cancer incidence in UKB relative to the general population is greater for women than men).

                             In addition, the available sample size and number of incident cases for women in our Integrated Modelling Cohort fell slightly short of sample size requirements (see Supplementary Methods). As a result our estimates of risk may be less precise for women, and external validation would be essential prior to implementation. The QCancer-10 model has previously been shown to perform worse when validated in UKB than in the QResearch validation.

                             This is likely to be due to the differences in age distribution between the general population sample used to develop the original QCancer-10 score and the more restricted UKB sample in this study. External validation of a separate QCancer (colorectal) score for symptomatic patients in an independent population-based cohort showed comparable performance to the discovery study.

                             Overall, risk model performance should be validated in a population representative of the screening population, and we have shown that PRS calibration can be largely corrected in new (ethnically similar) populations by recalibration.

Another major limitation of our study, and PRS generally, is that most models are developed in individuals of European ethnicity.

                             In population cancer screening programmes, in contrast, a risk score with moderate predictive value has considerable potential for improving current performance through patient stratification. Our risk score predicts that ∼10% of the population aged ∼40-70 have relative risks of CRC high enough to warrant enhanced surveillance under guidelines used in familial risk.

Nevertheless, we emphasise that validation of the risk score in a cohort representative of the screening population and evaluation in a prospective trial are required to evaluate the performance, acceptability and cost effectiveness of a combined risk model in a FIT-based bowel cancer screening programme.
