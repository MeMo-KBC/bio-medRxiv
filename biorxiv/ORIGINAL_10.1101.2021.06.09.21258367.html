  <meta name="DC.Description" content="This study aims to elucidate the relationship between the wrist and finger movements and forearm muscle activation of people with different typing skills. It hypothesizes that skilled typists (STs) can move their wrist and finger joints faster than unskilled typists (UTs) can because they can efficiently use their muscles according to the activity characteristics of the flexors and extensors of the wrist joint. During the typing task, we measured wrist and finger movements using a 3D motion capture system and forearm muscle activation using surface electromyography. The angular velocity of the wrist and finger flexion/extension and the muscle activation of the wrist flexors was higher in the STs than that in the UTs while the muscle activation of the wrist extensors was higher in the latter than that in the former. Our results showed that STs may have used their forearm muscles to take advantage of the physical characteristics of the keys and the spring characteristics of their muscles and tendons. It was suggested that they placed less mechanical stress on their finger muscles and tendons when pressing and releasing the keys.

                             This study aims to elucidate the relationship between the wrist and finger movements and forearm muscle activation of people with different typing skills. It hypothesizes that skilled typists (STs) can move their wrist and finger joints faster than unskilled typists (UTs) can because they can efficiently use their muscles according to the activity characteristics of the flexors and extensors of the wrist joint. During the typing task, we measured wrist and finger movements using a 3D motion capture system and forearm muscle activation using surface electromyography. The angular velocity of the wrist and finger flexion/extension and the muscle activation of the wrist flexors was higher in the STs than that in the UTs while the muscle activation of the wrist extensors was higher in the latter than that in the former. Our results showed that STs may have used their forearm muscles to take advantage of the physical characteristics of the keys and the spring characteristics of their muscles and tendons. It was suggested that they placed less mechanical stress on their finger muscles and tendons when pressing and releasing the keys.

                             Computers are essential tools in modern society that we frequently use for long periods when working or studying. Most people, regardless of age, gender, or occupation, are required to use computers, with the continuing expansion of digital transformation. Typing is a particularly complex task that relies on many joints and muscles. During typing, finger movements are usually rapid and repetitive and people hold their hands continuously above the keyboard, exposing the tendons and sheaths of their wrist and fingers to mechanical stress (

                             ). In the next largest prospective study, 21% of workers who used computers for more than 15 h/ week developed wrist or finger-related disorders in 1 year, most of which were tendon disorders (

                             ). In a recent review, a dose–response relationship was plotted between the exposure of people to mechanical factors and the risk of UE- MSDs associated with their wrists and finger tendons (

                             In this context, typing is required in bodily kinesthetic learning to avoid overloads on wrist and finger joints and UE- MSDs, such as sports injuries. Previous research on typing proficiency and physical movements has mainly focused on skilled typists (STs) of high skill. Additionally, few studies have assessed the kinematic properties of the wrist and finger joints, even though typing primarily comprises wrist and finger movements (

                             To quantify the complex kinematic properties of wrists and fingers during typing, it is necessary to understand their structural characteristics and properly evaluate the coordination between them. The relationship between the synergistic motion of the wrist and finger joints in the sagittal plane is called the tenodesis function (

                             ). Particularly, the muscle tension of the finger joint does not increase excessively and the amount of tendon extension can be increased during wrist joint flexion. In this context, evaluating only the movements of the wrist or finger joint and related muscle activities may lead to a misinterpretation of the mechanical activation of the body. Therefore, the relationship between hand kinematic coordination and muscle activities needs to be properly assessed and the biomechanical risk factors that arise need to be determined. Previous studies have discussed hand and finger kinematics by analyzing the simple tapping of an index finger.

                             In this study, we evaluated repeated keystroke motions during typing to analyze wrist and finger kinematics during more complex repetitive motions. Movement styles may vary with proficiency because typing is a complex task controlled by many joints and muscles. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between wrist and finger movements and forearm muscle activation for different typing skills. We hypothesized that STs could move their wrists and fingers more efficiently than unskilled typists (UTs) could. The movement of their muscles depends on the characteristics of the flexor and extensor activities at the wrist joint.

After plotting the function of the power output and appearance probability of each muscle of each subject in each trial, we calculated the mean and SD values of the muscle activation at P = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9.

                             We hypothesized that the subjects of the ST group could move their wrist and finger joints faster than those of the UT group could because they could use their muscles according to the activity characteristics of the flexors and extensors of their wrist joint. The ST group had a higher muscle activation at the maximum activity level of the FCU, whereas the UT group had a higher muscle activation at all the ECR activity levels. The subjects of the ST group also moved the MCP joints of their wrists and index fingers faster than those of the UT group did. The press and release time results clearly explained the muscle activation and kinematics of the subjects during the experiment. This study revealed that repetitive keystrokes with muscle activity controls for efficient wrist and finger movements reduced muscle activation during typing. This study emphasizes the significance of assessing not only muscle activity but also the complementary movements of the wrists and fingers simultaneously when considering muscle activation and the risks associated with UE-MSDs during typing.

Additionally, because the finger flexors were stretched in the wrist extension posture, the mechanical stress on them and the tendons may have increased if active tension was generated in the stretched state when pressing the keys. Therefore, the controlled muscle activity of the ST group may be attributed to the increase in the peak level of muscle activity in the wrist flexors, thereby decreasing the muscle load and mechanical stress on the finger flexors.

The kinematic parameters of the MCP joint of the index finger showed no significant differences in the joint angle and RMS. The higher typing speed of the ST group was due to the fast movements of the wrist and finger joints and coordinated fast actions of the joints.

                              To move the wrist and finger joints efficiently, it is important to convert variables, such as inertia and gravity, into joint movements (Dennerlein, Kingma, 2007,
                              <a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-19">

                              ). As mentioned in 4.1, the ST group had muscle coordination that increased and decreased the FCR and ECR muscle activities, respectively. This may have allowed the ST group to maintain the downward inertial force generated in the fingertip immediately before pressing the keys and reduced the braking action. As a result, the joint angular velocity of the wrist and finger when pressing the keys was higher in the ST group.

                              Additionally, the ST group performed muscle activity control to reduce the ECR muscle activity during the experiment. This indicated that the ST group effectively used the spring action of the finger flexors to support the movement of the fingertips in resisting gravity during the transition from pressing the keys to releasing them. This inference also indicated the existence of a relationship between the fast movements of the wrist and finger joints.

                              We evaluated the muscle activation of the wrist joint during press and release times. The types and combinations of fingers that a person uses while typing vary by skill; however, the number of typists that do not use the index finger is small (

                              ). Additionally, the “U” key was most frequently entered using the right index finger, because vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in Japanese are always entered after the consonants.

                              The two groups showed similar activations of the wrist flexors (FCR and FCU) during the task and muscle activities during the press and release times. The ST group was also able to perform finger and wrist joint movements faster than the UT group could. Since the flexion movements of the MCP joint during the typing movements were synergistic with those of the wrist joint (Dennerlein, Kingma, 2007), it can be assumed that the ST group took advantage of the excessive muscle activity of the wrist flexors during keystrokes. Additionally, because the fingertips were in high-speed contact with the keys when pressing them, the wrist flexors may have acted excessively to maintain the posture of the hand against the reaction force from the keys. Finger flexor activity is activated after the onset of downward finger movement (

                              ); the ST group may have activated their wrist flexors in a coordinated manner. The ST group used this strategy because it increased the kinetic energy of their fingertips immediately after pressing the keys, producing a key release, which facilitated keystroke switching.

                              In this study, there was no difference in the angle of the wrist joint or the degree of change in the angle between the two groups; however, the muscle activation of the static activity level of the ECR, an extensor muscle of the wrist joint, was significantly higher in the UT group than that in the ST group. This may be due to the over-activation of the ECR in the UT group due to the lack of minimal muscle activity control despite the longer moment arm of the muscle. This action is antagonistic to the flexion movement of the finger and, therefore, may increase the muscle load on the finger flexors when pressing the keys.

                              Furthermore, the ECU muscles cause the hand to be raised after pressing the keys (Dennerlein, Kingma, 2007). The UT group could not efficiently utilize the spring properties of the finger flexor tendons, resulting in the overuse of the muscles acting on the extensor muscles of their wrist joint when lifting their fingertips. This may have increased the EMG load on the ECU muscles when releasing the keys. Additionally, there is a proportional relationship between the distance of the spatial movement of the hand after key release and the time interval before the next keystroke (Feit, Weir, 2016). Therefore, the UT group, which tended to have longer key release times, may have increased the muscle load on the ECU muscles during key release because of excessive attempts to lift and move the hands.

                              The measurement conditions in this study were not strict. The postures of the subjects were not constrained during the test; they could place their forearms on the desk or keep them floating. Since placing the forearm on the desk may decrease the activation of the extensor muscles of the wrist joint, the distance between the upper body and the keyboard and the space on the desk in front of the keyboard needs to be checked at the beginning of the measurement; and the effects of differences in the contact time and contact area between the desk and the forearm on the body during the task should be determined.

In future investigations, we intend to evaluate the movements of fingers other than that of the index finger and examine the relationships between changes in the posture, muscle activation, and the force exerted by fingertips during specific keystrokes.
