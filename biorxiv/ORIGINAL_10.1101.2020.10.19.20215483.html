  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Purpose The pandemic of Covid-19 has caused tremendous losses to lives and economy in the entire world. The machine learning models have been applied to the radiological images of the Covid-19 positive patients for disease prediction and severity assessment. However, a segmentation model for detecting the opacity regions like haziness, ground-glass opacity and lung consolidation from the Covid-19 positive chest X-rays is still lacking.

Methods The recently published collection of the radiological images for a rural population in United States had made the development of such a model a possibility, for the high quality images and consistent clinical measurements. We manually annotated 221 chest X-ray images with the lung fields and the opacity regions and trained a segmentation model for the opacity region using the Unet framework and the Resnet18 backbone. In addition, we applied the percentage of the opacity region over the area of the total lung fields for predicting the severity of patients.

Results The model has a good performance regarding the overlap between the predicted and the manually labelled opacity regions. The performance is comparable for both the testing data set and the validation data set which comes from very diverse sources. However, careful manual examinations by experienced radiologists show mistakes in the predictions, which could be caused by the anatomical complexities. Nevertheless, the percentage of the opacity region can predict the severity of the patients well in regards to the ICU admissions and mortality.

Conclusion In view of the above, our model is a successful first try in the development of a segmentation model for the opacity regions for the Covid-19 positive chest X-rays. However, additional work is needed before a robust model can be developed for the ultimate goal of the implementations in the clinical setting.

                              The pandemic of Covid-19 has caused tremendous losses to lives and economy in the entire world. The machine learning models have been applied to the radiological images of the Covid-19 positive patients for disease prediction and severity assessment. However, a segmentation model for detecting the opacity regions like haziness, ground-glass opacity and lung consolidation from the Covid-19 positive chest X-rays is still lacking.

                              The recently published collection of the radiological images for a rural population in United States had made the development of such a model a possibility, for the high quality images and consistent clinical measurements. We manually annotated 221 chest X-ray images with the lung fields and the opacity regions and trained a segmentation model for the opacity region using the Unet framework and the Resnet18 backbone. In addition, we applied the percentage of the opacity region over the area of the total lung fields for predicting the severity of patients.

                              The model has a good performance regarding the overlap between the predicted and the manually labelled opacity regions. The performance is comparable for both the testing data set and the validation data set which comes from very diverse sources. However, careful manual examinations by experienced radiologists show mistakes in the predictions, which could be caused by the anatomical complexities. Nevertheless, the percentage of the opacity region can predict the severity of the patients well in regards to the ICU admissions and mortality.

Accurate and fast scanning of the lung situations for assessment of the disease progression has become a global-wise ubiquitous requirement. During the peak period, more than 70,000 new cases were diagnosed almost every day in the United States, 7-10% among them were hospitalized, and 2% of the diagnosed population have to be sent to emergent departments who needed further assessment for ICU admissions. The clinical environment in the era of Covid-19 pandemic has become very challenging with high-pressure and stress.

                              Data augmentation is a powerful technique to increase the amount of data and prevent model overfitting. Since our dataset is very small, we applied several different augmentations: horizontal flip, affine transforms, perspective transform, brightness/contrast/colors manipulations, image blurring and sharpening, gaussian noise and random crops. All of these transformations were performed using Albumentations, a fast augmentation library[

We then used this metric as the opacity percentage for predicting the severity of the patients, which was extracted from the excel table of the primary data source. The prognosis of each patient was among 3 categories: recovered with no ICU admission; recovered after ICU admission or deceased after ICU admission. For this data source, all patients who were deceased had gone to the ICU. The receiver operating curve (ROC) for the ICU admission was plotted using the opacity percentage against whether a patient was admitted to the ICU. The receiver operating curve (ROC) for the mortality was plotted using the opacity percentage against whether a patient was deceased.

                              In the meantime, the validation dataset is from an alternative source. We usually expect the same or worse performance in the validation dataset as the model trained on a dataset with a limited variability may be lacking generalization capabilities to a dataset from an alternative source. The slightly more superior performance raises strong suspicions. These issues area covered in more detail in the discussion part.

                              Due to the questions and suspicions we had for the IoU scores in the above, we further explored this issue and found a problem that significantly affected the IoU score. As defined by the formulas, the denominators are the union of the 2 regions for the IoU score. However, for our dataset, there are a significant number of images that do not have any opacity regions. These images have radiology reports of “clear lungs”, and the model predicted regions are also usually none. Thus, by definition, the union of the manually labelled region and the predicted region is 0, and a meaningful IoU score can not be calculated. To prove our hypothesis above, we extracted those images without any manually labelled opacity regions from the whole dataset combining the training and testing data sets. Then we re-applied the IoU score metrics to the new model created. It turned out that for the subset of 71 images without opacity regions, the calculated IoU score was 2.4E-10, close to 0. But for the rest 150 images with manually labelled opacity regions, the calculated IoU score increased to 0.6143 from the previous measurements of 0.5157 for the training dataset and 0.4755 for the testing set. Thus, the adjusted corrected IoU score for the entire dataset should be around (0.6143*150 + 1*71)/221 = 0.738, a much acceptable good performance for a segmentation model.

                              The superior performance of IoU score on the validation dataset, however, may come from the fact that most of the images in the validation dataset do contain manually labelled opacity regions. After the adjustment above, the IoU score of the validation dataset is slightly worse than that of the training and testing data sets.

                              .a shows that the manual curated regions are very scattered, while the predicted regions cover larger and more consistent lung regions. This actually may represent the imperfections in the manual labeling process. This problem roots back to the ground truth for the opacity regions. This, however, is non-trivial. The boundary of the opacity region is very difficult to be clearly identified in the chest X-rays due to many issues, like image quality, patient anatomy, baseline disease etc. In the clinical setting, even experienced radiologists can identify a region of abnormality barely in a rough fashion. The clear delimitation of the abnormality boundaries are usually difficult, especially for lighter representations like ground glass opacity or haziness.

                              .c shows several tiny opacities in bilateral lung bases. However, the model may mistakenly predict the high density as an opacity. The high density is more likely due to the overlap of lung tissues instead of the ground glass opacities or consolidations caused by infections and exudates.

                             As discussed above, the model predictions may be defective in a series of conditions. The segmentation of the opacity area in the chest X ray is a challenging work, even for experienced radiologists. The clear delimitation of the opacities is not as easy as delimitation of a solid mass with clear margins like tumors.

                             In general, the model performance is acceptable. Model metrics of IoU score and F1 score show good overlap between the manually labelled area and the predicted regions. From our examinations, correct locations can be detected more than 80% of the time, however, the exact boundaries may need further improvement.

                             To eliminate the influences of the anatomical structures or external instruments like ribs, scapula, wires and pacemakers, we probably need to include more chest X-ray images to more carefully label opacities. Another future direction is to develop a more robust model that takes into account all of these confounding elements. A possibility could be a multi-category segmentation model that detects the different anatomical structures separately.

                             In this study, we have demonstrated the development of a segmentation model for opacity regions for chest X-rays of the Covid-19 positive patients. The model performance is generally good with a precise predicted location for the opacities. Besides, the model shows a good generalization capacity when applied to a validation dataset composed of images of different sources. In addition, the percentage of the predicted opacity regions over the total lung area can predict the patient severity well regarding ICU admission and mortality. The performance of patient severity prediction is comparable or slightly better than the previously published “opacity score” method. In despite of these results, the model has a lot of imperfections in predicting the correct opacity regions. This may not only root from the lack of training data diversity, but also from the imperfections in manual labeling. Additional work is needed before a robust and accurate model can be developed for the ultimate goal of implementation in the clinical setting. In view of the above, our model is a successful first try in developing a segmentation model for the opacity regions for the Covid-19 positive chest X-rays. Our model schema and the manual segmentation data set may lay the foundation for the progress of more robust and accurate lung segmentation models in the future.
