  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Objective The study objective was to compare gut microbiome diversity and composition in SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive patients whose symptoms ranged from asymptomatic to severe, versus PCR-negative exposed controls.

Design Using a cross-sectional design, we performed shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS) on stool samples to evaluate gut microbiome composition and diversity in both patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR- confirmed infections, that had presented to Ventura Clinical Trials for care from March 2020 through October 2021, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative exposed controls. Patients were classified as being asymptomatic or having mild, moderate, or severe symptoms based on NIH criteria. Exposed controls were individuals with prolonged or repeated close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or their samples, e.g. household members of patients or frontline healthcare workers. Microbiome diversity and composition were compared between patients and exposed controls at all taxonomic levels.

Results Compared with controls (n=20), severely symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n=28) had significantly less bacterial diversity (Shannon Index, P=0.0499; Simpson Index, P=0.0581), and positive patients overall had lower relative abundances of Bifidobacterium (P<0.0001), Faecalibacterium (P=0.0077), and Roseburium (P=0.0327), while having increased Bacteroides (P=0.0075). Interestingly, there was an inverse association between disease severity and abundance of the same bacteria.

Conclusion We hypothesize that low bacterial diversity and depletion of Bifidobacterium genera either before or after infection led to reduced pro-immune function, thereby allowing SARS-CoV-2 infection to become symptomatic. This particular dysbiosis pattern may be a susceptibility marker for symptomatic severity from SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be amenable to pre-, intra-, or post infection intervention.

  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Objective The study objective was to compare gut microbiome diversity and composition in SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive patients whose symptoms ranged from asymptomatic to severe, versus PCR-negative exposed controls.

Design Using a cross-sectional design, we performed shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS) on stool samples to evaluate gut microbiome composition and diversity in both patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR- confirmed infections, that had presented to Ventura Clinical Trials for care from March 2020 through October 2021, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative exposed controls. Patients were classified as being asymptomatic or having mild, moderate, or severe symptoms based on NIH criteria. Exposed controls were individuals with prolonged or repeated close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or their samples, e.g. household members of patients or frontline healthcare workers. Microbiome diversity and composition were compared between patients and exposed controls at all taxonomic levels.

Results Compared with controls (n=20), severely symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n=28) had significantly less bacterial diversity (Shannon Index, P=0.0499; Simpson Index, P=0.0581), and positive patients overall had lower relative abundances of Bifidobacterium (P<0.0001), Faecalibacterium (P=0.0077), and Roseburium (P=0.0327), while having increased Bacteroides (P=0.0075). Interestingly, there was an inverse association between disease severity and abundance of the same bacteria.

Conclusion We hypothesize that low bacterial diversity and depletion of Bifidobacterium genera either before or after infection led to reduced pro-immune function, thereby allowing SARS-CoV-2 infection to become symptomatic. This particular dysbiosis pattern may be a susceptibility marker for symptomatic severity from SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be amenable to pre-, intra-, or post infection intervention.

                              Using a cross-sectional design, we performed shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS) on stool samples to evaluate gut microbiome composition and diversity in both patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR- confirmed infections, that had presented to Ventura Clinical Trials for care from March 2020 through October 2021, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative exposed controls. Patients were classified as being asymptomatic or having mild, moderate, or severe symptoms based on NIH criteria. Exposed controls were individuals with prolonged or repeated close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or their samples, e.g. household members of patients or frontline healthcare workers. Microbiome diversity and composition were compared between patients and exposed controls at all taxonomic levels.

                              Compared with controls (n=20), severely symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n=28) had significantly less bacterial diversity (Shannon Index, P=0.0499; Simpson Index, P=0.0581), and positive patients overall had lower relative abundances of Bifidobacterium (P<0.0001), Faecalibacterium (P=0.0077), and Roseburium (P=0.0327), while having increased Bacteroides (P=0.0075). Interestingly, there was an inverse association between disease severity and abundance of the same bacteria.

                              </strong>
                              We hypothesize that low bacterial diversity and depletion of Bifidobacterium genera either before or after infection led to reduced pro-immune function, thereby allowing SARS-CoV-2 infection to become symptomatic. This particular dysbiosis pattern may be a susceptibility marker for symptomatic severity from SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be amenable to pre-, intra-, or post infection intervention.

After DNA quantification, the DNA was normalized, i.e. all samples begin library preparation (following DNA extraction and purification) with 100 ng input of DNA. Libraries were then prepared using shotgun methodology with Illumina‟s Nextera Flex kit. Samples then underwent the shotgun metagenomic processing procedure of tagmentation, amplification, indexing, and purification. Following completion of this shotgun metagenomic standard protocol, purified libraries were again normalized to standardize sequencing depth during the NGS run on the NextSeq 500/550. We achieved consistency of sequencing depth (ie number of reads) by normalizing the samples‟ pooling concentrations (ie molarity), loading the same number of samples per sequencing run, consistently using the same NextSeq High Output kits.

                              After completion of sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq with 500/550 High-Output Kits v2.5 (300 cycles), the raw data was streamed in real-time to Illumina‟s BaseSpace cloud for FASTQ conversion. The FASTQ files were then sent through One Codex‟s bioinformatics pipeline for metagenomic annotation and analyses to elucidate the microflora composition and relative abundances of the top genera and species for all patients and controls.

                              We assessed differences in relative abundance across taxa between the gut microbiome of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and exposed controls and calculated Shannon and Simpson alpha diversity indices with One Codex‟s bioinformatics analysis pipeline utilizing Jupyter Notebook in Python. Specifically, the One Codex Database consists of ∼114K complete microbial genomes (One Codex, San Francisco, CA, USA). During processing, reads were first screened against the human genome, then mapped to the microbial reference database using a k-mer based classification. Individual sequences (NGS read or contig) were compared against the One Codex Database (One Codex) by exact alignment using k-mers, where k = 31(43, 44). Based on the relative frequency, unique k-mers were filtered to control for sequencing or reference genome artifacts.

                              The sequencing depth followed ProgenaBiome‟s standard operating procedures and was 8,239,475 reads on average for this study. One should note that shallow metagenomic sequencing is typically only 0.5 million reads but is still considered sufficient for taxonomic phyla level analysis (and even genera for the most abundant bacteria).

                              The relative abundance of each microbial taxonomic classification was estimated based on the depth and coverage of sequencing across every available reference genome. Beta-diversity was calculated as weighted UniFrac distance visualized in a distance matrix using the phylum-level relative abundance obtained from One Codex. 13 genera were selected based on our experience and knowledge of critical players in the gut microbiome, as well as similarity to other studies [

                             Given our cross-sectional study design, it is not possible to determine whether the differences in Bifidobacterium levels observed between patients and exposed controls preceded or followed infection. If preceding infection, they could be a marker of susceptibility and boosting Bifidobacterium levels might decrease the risk or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. If these changes followed infection, alteration of the gut microbiome (such as through fecal microbiota transplantation or possibly probiotic supplementation) to increase Bifidobacterium spp. could be an area worth exploring for improved outcomes. If future studies can demonstrate improved outcomes, such therapy can be considered for complex cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as “long- haulers,” and those with severe disease. Developing outbreaks within tightly closed communities such as nursing homes might be a good setting in which to assess susceptibility: fecal samples could be collected during the outbreak and run post hoc on “cases” and “controls.” Future studies of individuals with baseline pre-pandemic microbiome data would be highly valuable, although acquiring such baseline pre-infection microbiome data is still costly.

                             With the lack of data on the gut microbiome prior to onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we cannot completely rule out the confounding effect of illness on the microbiome. Nonetheless, we eliminated effects of treatment on the gut microbiome by sampling prior to administration of SARS-CoV-2 infection therapeutics of any kind and within 48 hrs. of symptom onset. Specifically, no subjects were given antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatory medicines, oxygen, or any other therapeutic agent between symptom onset or PCR positivity, and stool sampling. We also note that the prevalence of appetite changes, alterations of stool frequency, and GI symptoms, in general, were not significantly different between any of the severity groups or controls (

                             ), although the small sample sizes for some groups should be considered in evaluating these statistics.

                             SARS-CoV-2 infection presentation variability correlates with colon microbiome bacterial composition and overall diversity. The same changes we observe due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, namely reduced Bifidobacterium and/or Faecalibacterium abundance, are associated with SARS- CoV-2 infection risk factors including old age, obesity, and diabetes.[

                             In summary, we demonstrate in a study of PCR-positive and PCR-negative SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, reduced bacterial diversity and reduced levels of various genus / species are highly associated with both SARS-CoV-2 positivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection severity. These findings suggest that probiotic supplementation or fecal microbiota transplantation should be explored as a potential therapeutic avenue, for SARS-CoV-2 patients. Additionally, individual colon microbiome evaluation may predict vulnerability to the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lastly, our data suggest a new area for exploration: if SARS-CoV-2 severity is found to be dependent on the microbiome, then accounting for microbiome differences could reduce variability in outcomes for SARS-CoV-2.
