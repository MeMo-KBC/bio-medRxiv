  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Objectives It is important to determine an accurate demarcation line (DL) between the cancerous lesions and background mucosa in magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI)-based diagnosis. However, it is difficult for novice endoscopists. Our aim was to automatically determine the accurate DL using a machine learning method.

Methods We used an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the DLs because it can reduce the burden of training machine learning models and labeling large datasets. Our method consists of the following four steps: 1) An M-NBI image is segmented into superpixels (a group of neighboring pixels) using simple linear iterative clustering. 2) The image features are extracted for each superpixel. 3) The superpixels are grouped into several clusters using the k-means method. 4) The boundaries of the clusters are extracted as DL candidates. To validate the proposed method, 23 M-NBI images of 11 cases were used for performance evaluation. The evaluation investigated the similarity of the DLs identified by endoscopists and our method, and the Euclidean distance between the two DLs was calculated. For the single case of 11 cases, the histopathological examination was also conducted and was used to evaluate the proposed system.

Results The average Euclidean distances for the 11 cases were10.65, 11.97, 7.82, 8.46, 8.59, 9.72, 12.20, 9.06, 22.86, 8.45, and 25.36. The results indicated that the specific selection of the number of clusters enabled the proposed method to detect DLs that were similar to those of the endoscopists. The DLs identified by our method represented the complex shapes of the DLs, similarly to those identified by experienced doctors. Also, it was confirmed that the proposed system could generate the pathologically valid DLs by increasing the number of clusters.

Conclusions Our proposed system can support the training of inexperienced doctors, as well as enrich the knowledge of experienced doctors in endoscopy.

                              It is important to determine an accurate demarcation line (DL) between the cancerous lesions and background mucosa in magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI)-based diagnosis. However, it is difficult for novice endoscopists. Our aim was to automatically determine the accurate DL using a machine learning method.

                              We used an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the DLs because it can reduce the burden of training machine learning models and labeling large datasets. Our method consists of the following four steps: 1) An M-NBI image is segmented into superpixels (a group of neighboring pixels) using simple linear iterative clustering. 2) The image features are extracted for each superpixel. 3) The superpixels are grouped into several clusters using the k-means method. 4) The boundaries of the clusters are extracted as DL candidates. To validate the proposed method, 23 M-NBI images of 11 cases were used for performance evaluation. The evaluation investigated the similarity of the DLs identified by endoscopists and our method, and the Euclidean distance between the two DLs was calculated. For the single case of 11 cases, the histopathological examination was also conducted and was used to evaluate the proposed system.

                              The average Euclidean distances for the 11 cases were10.65, 11.97, 7.82, 8.46, 8.59, 9.72, 12.20, 9.06, 22.86, 8.45, and 25.36. The results indicated that the specific selection of the number of clusters enabled the proposed method to detect DLs that were similar to those of the endoscopists. The DLs identified by our method represented the complex shapes of the DLs, similarly to those identified by experienced doctors. Also, it was confirmed that the proposed system could generate the pathologically valid DLs by increasing the number of clusters.

                             ]. Furthermore, the incorrect recognition of the demarcation line (DL) is disadvantageous to patients. When endoscopists underestimate the DL, this may lead to non-curative resection. In contrast, if they overestimate the DL, they may perform ESD containing extensive unnecessary lesions, increasing the risk of perforation or a long procedure time. Therefore, it is important to determine an accurate DL between the cancerous lesions and background mucosa. However, this determination is difficult for novice endoscopists, with the required long-term training and experience.

First, it is necessary to prepare an enormous amount of annotated training data (for example, ‘lesion’ or ‘non-lesion’ labels are provided to each datum by endoscopists) to construct the classification model. These annotations need to be performed by highly experienced endoscopists and are therefore impractical.

                             Consequently, the boundary between the gastric cancer lesions and background mucosa, the DL, can be identified. The diagnosis rationale or criteria can be interpreted following the determination of the DL because we specify the potentially discriminating features of gastric cancer before performing the data clustering. Furthermore, the proposed method does not require any annotations or computational efforts. Thus, the approach can be applied to determine the DL for early gastric cancer diagnosis.

First, an input M-NBI image is segmented into a certain number of superpixels, each set of pixels with similar color features. Second, the image features, including the colors and the texture features, are calculated for each superpixel. Third, the superpixels are grouped into a predetermined number of clusters using a data clustering method. Finally, the boundaries of the multiple clusters are extracted as the DL candidates and are presented to the users of the proposed system (endoscopists). The majority of data clustering methods divide the dataset into clusters to minimize the intracluster distance or/and maximize the intercluster distance. Therefore, we hypothesized that the DL could be extracted as the boundary of the clusters because the cancer lesions that would have different image features from the non-cancer lesions should form the cluster. Note that our system was designed to identify only the DL ‘candidates’, so it does not require image annotation by endoscopists. The final decision of selecting the DL from the candidates is the responsibility of the user endoscopists. The details of each of the four steps are described in the following sections.

In the SLIC algorithm, a group of pixels that are similar in terms of both their color features and position (coordinates) is formed as a superpixel. The boundary shapes of the superpixels are iteratively refined by means of the well-known k-means-based clustering approach. First, the input image is divided into a certain number of grids. The center of each tile (the initial form of a superpixel) is sampled and then moved to the pixel with the lowest color gradient among the neighboring pixels. Thereafter, for each pixel in the entire image, the nearest center pixel in terms of both the color and coordinate spaces is searched, and it is assigned to the member of the identified pixel. This procedure is repeated until certain types of termination criteria are satisfied, so that the superpixels are generated. For further details on SLIC, please refer to the original paper [

In brief, the entropy used in this case quantifies the variability of the pixel values in the image. That is, we assumed that the irregularities of the microvascular and microsurface patterns could be represented by the probability distribution of the pixel values. Note that we calculated the local entropy score for each color dimension.

                               In total, we used 12-dimensional feature vectors (that is, the six color dimensions L*, a*, b*, H, S, and V and the local entropy score for each of the six color dimensions) for the global clustering by the k-means method. We used the KMeans function implemented in scikit-learn.

                               Following the global clustering of the superpixels, the boundaries of the clusters are extracted as the DL candidates and are presented on the graphical user interface for the user endoscopists. As mentioned previously, our system is designed to provide the DL candidates and not to determine the exact DL. The final decision on the DL determination is made by the endoscopists by selecting one of the candidates. In this situation, it is necessary to provide varieties of candidates for the users. Therefore, global clustering with different numbers of clusters (the control parameter k of the k-means method) was executed to provide the DL candidates at different segmentation levels of the M-NBI image. Examples of the cluster boundaries identified following the global clustering are illustrated in

                               For the SLIC during the local clustering process, the number of segments (superpixels) of a given image, ‘compactness’ parameter, which controls the balance between the color and space proximity, and ‘sigma’ parameter, which indicates the width of the Gaussian smoothing kernel for each color dimension, were set to 100, 5, and 5 for L*, a*, and b*, respectively. Moreover, for the global clustering process, the maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a single run was set to 300. The initial cluster centers were determined by the k-means++ algorithm to accelerate convergence. The execution was carried out with different k settings: k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since the clustering result by k-means depends on the first data point chosen as the centroid for each cluster, it was performed for 10 trials for each k setting, and the best clustering result that indicated the minimum value of the inertia, sum of squared distances of samples to their nearest cluster center, was chosen as the DL candidate.

                              indicates that the DL candidates provided by the proposed method became more similar to the endoscopist identification with an increase in the number of clusters. In most cases, the changes in the Euclidean distance were remarkable when k ranged from 2 to 4 and were saturated at k >= 4. The approximation accuracy was improved with an increase in the number of clusters because the complexity of the boundary shape increased. These results suggest that the proposed method could identify DL candidates that sufficiently approximated the endoscopist criteria at k = 4.

At k = 3, although the boundary was added in the FOV, it simply divided the FOV into two regions where the brightness of the clusters was differentiated. At k = 4, the boundary was finally drawn between the clusters with different mucosal patterns. It can be observed that the DL candidate at k >= 4 overlapped the DL provided by the endoscopist. These results visually confirm the assumption that our proposed method could sufficiently approximate the endoscopist criteria at k = 4.

                              Therefore, it is confirmed that our proposed method could identify the DL similar to that provided by the endoscopist at approximately the number of clusters k = 4. Obviously, as this process depends on the varieties of M-NBI images, user endoscopists would select the appropriate one by adjusting the k value themselves. However, the observation of multiple DL candidates at different k values may offer new insights into endoscopic diagnosis to user endoscopists, because our method can indicate DLs in regions where endoscopists cannot provide a clear demarcation. This is one of the most important contributions of our study.

                              A further contribution of our study is that it provides the boundary ‘line’ itself, instead of indicating the cancer lesions as a ‘region’. For example, Li et al. [

Providing a ‘line’ rather than a ‘region’ using a CAD system is meaningful in enriching the knowledge of both inexperienced and experienced endoscopists.

                              In determining the horizontal extent of early gastric mucosal cancer using M-NBI, it is necessary to identify the DL to differentiate the mucosal patterns between cancer lesions and background mucosa.

The existence of the larger shaded regions in the M-NBI image leads to unnecessary segmentations for them. Even at k >=17, the shape of the clusters in the shared regions varied, as shown in

                              . To overcome this issue, it is necessary to incorporate the predetermination of the regions of interest in the M-NBI images. Nonetheless, it was confirmed that the current system could generate the pathologically valid DL by increasing the number of clusters, k.

                              However, this study exhibits certain limitations. First, the small sample size (n = 11) is problematic. Our system needs to be tested with a larger sample size to improve its reliability and robustness. This work focused on the proposal and development of a general framework for an automatic DL determination algorithm based on a data clustering method. Second, each DL may contain an individual bias because a single endoscopist drew it for each image. Although the DLs were assessed by multiple doctors in the present data, the other DL candidates should be provided by various endoscopists to reduce such bias. Thirds, the current study was conducted using only the still M-NBI images. With a recent advance in CAD systems using video images, the future direction should be to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed system using video images. This would be also effective for increasing the sample size. These issues should be addressed for future studies to improve the system reliability and to proceed to clinical trials. However, irrespective of these limitations, the current results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and will contribute to the development of gastroenterology.

                              In summary, we developed a new CAD system that can automatically determine the DL on a given M-NBI image through an ML method. In the proposed system, the boundaries of the clusters within M-NBI images are extracted as the DL candidates. The performance evaluation of the system on actual M-NBI images revealed that it can represent the complex shapes of the DLs, similarly to the DLs identified by experienced doctors. The identification of the DL is often quite a difficult task for inexperienced endoscopists. Therefore, our proposed system, which can provide a variety of DL candidates, may support the training of inexperienced doctors, as well as enrich the knowledge of experienced doctors.
