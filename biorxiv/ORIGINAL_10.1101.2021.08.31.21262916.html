  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Measles remains a significant source of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. Two doses of measles containing vaccine are recommended for all children and delivered through a combination of routine and supplemental immunization activities. Uncertainty about the degree to which second dose opportunities reach previously unvaccinated children presents a challenge in the assessment of vaccination programs and the estimation of the global burden of measles disease and mortality.

Methods We fit an ensemble of models that represent alternative assumptions about the degree to which second dose opportunities reach previously unvaccinated children to routine measles surveillance from 100 countries. Using maximum likelihood we selected the best fit model for each country. We compare the resulting estimates of the burden of measles disease and mortality to existing methods for estimating the burden of measles that assume that second dose opportunities are independent of receipt of the first dose.

Findings We find that 78 of 100 countries are best-fit by a model that assumes that second doses that are delivered through supplemental campaigns are preferentially delivered to children who have received a first dose. Using a country-specific best-fit model we estimate that measles mortality has declined by 73% from 2000-2019 compared to an estimated decline of 83% using an assumption of independent doses in all countries.

Interpretation Despite large decreases in measles cases over the last two decades, the observed trajectories in most countries suggest that supplemental immunization activities are disproportionately reaching previously vaccinated children. To accelerate measles reduction goals efforts to reach unvaccinated children through supplemental activities and second dose opportunities should be intensified.

                              Measles remains a significant source of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. Two doses of measles containing vaccine are recommended for all children and delivered through a combination of routine and supplemental immunization activities. Uncertainty about the degree to which second dose opportunities reach previously unvaccinated children presents a challenge in the assessment of vaccination programs and the estimation of the global burden of measles disease and mortality.

                              We fit an ensemble of models that represent alternative assumptions about the degree to which second dose opportunities reach previously unvaccinated children to routine measles surveillance from 100 countries. Using maximum likelihood we selected the best fit model for each country. We compare the resulting estimates of the burden of measles disease and mortality to existing methods for estimating the burden of measles that assume that second dose opportunities are independent of receipt of the first dose.

                              We find that 78 of 100 countries are best-fit by a model that assumes that second doses that are delivered through supplemental campaigns are preferentially delivered to children who have received a first dose. Using a country-specific best-fit model we estimate that measles mortality has declined by 73% from 2000-2019 compared to an estimated decline of 83% using an assumption of independent doses in all countries.

                              Despite large decreases in measles cases over the last two decades, the observed trajectories in most countries suggest that supplemental immunization activities are disproportionately reaching previously vaccinated children. To accelerate measles reduction goals efforts to reach unvaccinated children through supplemental activities and second dose opportunities should be intensified.

                             ), this timescale allows a common model to be fit to all countries over a long time frame (1980 to present) based on reporting by member states to the World Health Organization (WHO) to permit consistent evaluation of changes in global measles burden and the impact of vaccination programs. Here we describe an update to the original Simons et al(
                             <a id="xref-ref-6-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">

                             First, the original Simons model assumed a phenomenological relationship between the measles attack rate and the proportion of the population that is susceptible that was linear when susceptibility was low. Thus, while the probability that a susceptible individual is infected is smallest when the proportion susceptible is small, it increases most quickly as the proportion susceptible increases at small values. This is inconsistent with the expected non-linear behavior of indirect protection below the herd immunity threshold (e.g. 3-5% of the population susceptible)(
                             <a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">

                             ) where the attack rate should increase slowly as the susceptible population increases below the threshold, and sharply thereafter. Here we include this non-linear effect.

                            <p id="p-23">
                             Second, the original Simons model assumed that the error distribution around burden estimates was Gaussian with constant variance. This assumption allowed fast computation, but leads to counterintuitive phenomena; specifically, the width of confidence bounds do not scale with burden and negative lower bounds are permitted (though were excluded post hoc). Here we employ a binomial error distribution that scales with burden and is constrained to positive values.
                            </p>
                            <p id="p-24">
                             Third, the original Simons model was not explicitly age-specific; the age distribution of the susceptible population, and thus impact of age-targeted supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) was approximated based on region and measles vaccination coverage (
                             <a id="xref-ref-6-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">
                              6
                             </a>
                             ). Here we extend the model to explicitly account for the age distribution of the susceptible population, which allows direct calculation of the impact of SIAs on individual targeted age groups.

                             Last, the original Simons model assumed that all measles containing vaccine doses were delivered independently of prior vaccination. Though the explicit correlation between vaccination doses is difficult to know for all countries, numerous studies have shown that second dose opportunities (through routine or SIA doses) tend to underperform nominal coverage values because of inequities in access to care (
                             <a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">

                             ); i.e. second opportunities are disproportionately delivered to those who received a first dose. To address this uncertainty in the interaction among vaccine doses, we fit an ensemble of models to each country that reflect alternative assumptions about the correlation between routine first dose, routine second dose, and SIA doses. Thus, rather than making a single assumption for all countries, we use maximum likelihood to select the country-specific evidence-based model for the correlation among vaccine doses.

                             Below, we expand the details of these model updates and compare the resulting estimates of the global burden of measles incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2019. We then report on the insights gained from fitting alternative measles dose correlation models and the implications for projecting the future impact of measles vaccination investments.

Using coverage data as well as vaccination coverage survey data sourced from published and grey literature, WHO and UNICEF estimate the national immunization coverage for timely fist dose of MCV (MCV1) and second dose of MCV (MCV2) administered through routine immunization services (not mass campaigns), updating the entire time series from 1980-previous year (

Children who receive late doses past these ages are not included in the calculation. For MCV2, it is calculated among one birth cohort of children at the recommended age for administration of MCV2, per the national immunization schedule. Again, vaccination given after the recommended age is not counted towards the estimated MCV2 coverage.

                              ). SIAs are frequently mass vaccination campaigns that attempt to vaccinate all persons within a target age group in a few days or weeks. The list included the upper and lower age target and coverage achieved for each campaign. For age limits that were not in integer years, we scaled the coverage relative to the portion of the age cohort covered: e.g. a lower age target of 9 months vaccinated is calculated as .25 x coverage in the 0-1 age cohort. The coverage of subnational SIAs was scaled to the proportion of the total population included in the subnational target. The date of SIAs was coded only as the year in which it was conducted. Uncertainty about whether the impact of SIAs is first observed in the year of the campaign (i.e. campaign was conducted early in the year) or in the year following the campaign (i.e. campaign was conducted late in the year) was addressed by fitting alternative models (see below).

                              Surveillance identifies a small proportion of cases that occur, even in countries with very good surveillance—for example some persons will never seek care and thus remain invisible to the surveillance system, while other times clinicians fail to report cases to public health. However, during an outbreak, surveillance is frequently intensified as recommended by WHO (

                              ), with awareness raised among the public and clinicians. This can lead to improved reporting during this period. To account for these periods of increased reported, WHO experts review the surveillance data to determine if the country is having a high reporting rate in any given year. A list of years when reporting was enhanced in individual countries, e.g. due to outbreak response, was provided by WHO.

For a = 1, this reflects the number of non-immunized births as a function of MCV1 coverage and the efficacy: new susceptibles are new births times (1 – MCV1 coverage x efficacy), where efficacy is assumed to be 84 or 93% for countries that administer the first dose at 9 or 12 months respectively (

The total number of cases was first estimated using a Kalman filter and then the estimate of total cases was disaggregated to age-specific cases based on an analysis of the distribution of observed cases by WHO region and MCV1 coverage level. Thus, the age distribution of cases for a country did not change from year to year unless the MCV1 level changed from one coverage stratum to another (coverage strata: 0-59%, 60-84%,85-100%). The changes described above result in an age distribution of infections and the susceptible population that changes year-to-year depending on the attack rate and age-targeted vaccination.

                              In practice, for computational speed, we approximate the likelihood as a mixture of a normal distribution with mean M and variance V and a Cauchy distribution with mean M and scale V; where M and V are the corresponding mean and variance of the binomial distribution. The mixture is 0.99 weight on the Normal distribution. This approximation is faster computationally because it does not evaluate the large factorials for the equivalent binomial likelihood and the fat tail of the Cauchy prevents complete particle depletion when evaluating parameter combinations with very low likelihood.

                              Depending on the timing of campaigns and the predominant seasonality of measles, the impact of SIAs on case numbers may be observed in the year of the campaign or in the year following the campaign. In practice, this should be considered independently for each SIA; however, the dates of SIAs are not consistently recorded at this level of resolution. Here we fit two versions of each model: one in which the SIA reduces susceptibles in the year in which it was conducted and one in which the SIA reduces susceptibles in the year following the campaign.

This reduced range corresponds to the parameter space that contains the highest 5% of likelihood values in the initial search.

For each country, we select the best model as that model with the highest likelihood at its maximum likelihood parameter estimates. In the supplement we illustrate the performance of this likelihood-based model selection using a simulation experiment. Briefly, for 5 country examples, we simulate observed case dynamics under each of several models and then fit all candidate models to these simulated time series. We then quantify the percentage of times for which the generating model is selected as the first or second best-fit.

We then evaluate the particle filter at these 100 parameter combinations (many of which may be identical) and combine the resulting distribution of particles. We take the mean and quantiles of this distribution as estimates of the mean and confidence interval for the true number of infections in each age cohort and year.

                              For global totals of measles infections and deaths, we present 2 totals. First, we present an optimistic total, where all countries fitted with model that assumes independent doses; this assumes that all second opportunities are delivered independently and at random with respect the receipt of the first routine dose and is the assumption made in the Simons et al (

The confidence intervals for the new model estimates are considerably reduced, reflecting the different error structure. Notably, because the new model assumes a binomial error, the width of the confidence interval scales with the mean burden of cases.

The assumed age distribution in the Simons model changes only in response to routine first-dose MCV coverage. The country-specific best-fit estimates for the new model predict that a smaller fraction of cases are under 5 years of age (e.g. in 2017, 86/100 countries were predicted to have a smaller fraction of cases under 5 years than in the Simons model). Since the CFR is assumed to be higher in children under 5 years (

                             Though there have been dramatic reductions in the overall burden of measles disease and mortality over the last 2 decades, the recent resurgence of measles remains a concern. The methods we have described here result in narrower confidence intervals on estimated measles burden, which highlights that the recent increases are unlikely to be the result of random variation in reporting. Estimates derived from the prior method described in Simons et al (
                             <a id="xref-ref-6-10" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">

                             ) result in confidence intervals that do not scale with mean incidence and thereby obscure the recent increases in burden.

                             By fitting an ensemble of models, reflecting alternative assumptions about the correlation between first and second dose opportunities (routine and SIAs) this analysis highlights the dependence of burden estimates on these assumptions. Despite various changes in model structure (see Methods) assuming independence of first and second dose opportunities in the new model results in central estimates of the burden of measles that are consistent with the Simons model estimates. However, we find that the majority of countries were better fit by models that assume that either SIAs or both SIAs and routine second doses are correlated with the first dose.

                             Though the SIA-MCV1 correlated and all doses correlated models were better supported, we cannot infer directly the reason that the time series for these countries are less well fit by the independent or MCV2-MCV1 correlated models. The formulation of the SIA-MCV1 and all doses correlated models are consistent with a strict interpretation of correlation among first and second dose opportunities; specifically, that second doses are delivered first to those who have received a prior first dose and remaining doses are then randomly distributed to those who have not received a first dose. Phenomenologically, this results in dynamics that are consistent with routine second dose and SIA coverage that is lower than the nominal administrative coverage. This difference could arise because of dependence among doses, which could be due to inequity in access to both routine and SIA services (

                             ). Alternatively, this same pattern could arise if administrative SIA coverage routinely overestimates coverage achieved (e.g. because of underestimates of the target population size). We note that the 4 candidate models we explore here are extreme assumptions of either no correlation or strict correlation among doses. The truth is likely to be intermediate in all cases and future work should explore support for alternative models.

                             Regardless of mechanism, the finding that observed dynamics are frequently consistent with routine second doses and SIAs performing below nominal coverage has important implications for planning of measles vaccination investments. Countries for which second dose opportunities that underperform nominal coverage may be expected to continue to do so in the future in the absence of explicit investments to address equity in coverage. Here we fit an ensemble of models that range from optimistic (independent) to pessimistic (all doses correlated) assumptions about the immunization impact of second dose programs. Future projections of the impact of vaccination investments could use this ensemble of models, with equal weights or weights based on likelihood (

                             ), this model does not include several important aspects of measles transmission dynamics because of limited data availability over the full time series. Specifically, we ignore the effect of seasonal variation in measles transmission because consistent data are only available at the annual time scale for most countries since 1980. Further, we assume homogenous mixing among all age classes because age-specific case reporting is not consistently available over this time period. Efforts to develop age-specific mixing matrices for all countries (e.g.(
                             <a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">

Thus, the role of age-structure in this model is to permit explicit representation of age-targeted vaccination interventions. The availability of weekly or monthly and age-specific case reporting (e.g. (

Finally, we assume that vaccination coverage, due to all sources, is homogeneous at the sub-national level. Various analyses have shown that subnational variation in vaccination coverage can be significant (

                             This work highlights the importance of continuing to update models for burden estimation to account for technical and data quality advances. Here we show that the existing methods, based on an optimistic assumption of the impact of second dose opportunities lead to lower estimates of the burden of measles disease and mortality and are less well supported when compared to models that assume that receipt of the second dose is correlated with the receipt of the first dose. The performance of measles control and elimination would benefit from both improved coverage and efforts to extend vaccination to populations consistently missed by current programs (

                             ). Further, investment in strengthening national surveillance programs would permit continued development of mechanistic burden estimation models that can account for dynamics (age-structured mixing, seasonality) that must currently be excluded due to limitations of data quality.
