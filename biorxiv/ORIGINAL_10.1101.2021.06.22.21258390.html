  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Introduction Therapeutic mammoplasty (TM) is a type of oncoplastic breast surgery (OBS) well suited to breast cancers in medium-large sized breasts with ptosis, and in some cases of large or multifocal/Multicentric (MF/MC) tumors. It includes contralateral symmetrisation. This report describes our experiences and outcomes of TM in breast cancer patients in a single institutional cohort in India.

Methods We present data for 207 cases (194 breast cancer, 13 benign disease) who underwent TM as part of their primary treatment. All patients underwent surgery after careful analysis of feasibility by a multidisciplanary tumor board and patient counselling. We report the clinicopathological profiles, surgical and oncological outcomes, and patient related outcome measures (PROMs) with different TM surgical procedures.

Results Patients were relatively young at a median age of 49 years with moderate-large breasts and grade II-III ptosis. Patients underwent simple (n=96), complex (n=79) or extreme TM (n=46). Low post-operative complication rates and good-excellent cosmetic scores were observed. With median follow-up of 26 months, 148 patients completed more than 1 year follow-up. The 1-year BREAST-Q PROMs revealed good-to-excellent scores for all types of therapeutic mammoplasty.

Conclusion We conclude that in a country where women present with large and locally advanced tumours, TM safely expands the indications for breast conservation surgery. PROMs scores show that this surgery is perceived to be physically and mentally satisfactory. With the popularization of this procedure, it is possible that more Indian patients with breast cancer will receive the benefits of breast conservation while maintaining their quality of life.

Methods We present data for 207 cases (194 breast cancer, 13 benign disease) who underwent TM as part of their primary treatment. All patients underwent surgery after careful analysis of feasibility by a multidisciplanary tumor board and patient counselling. We report the clinicopathological profiles, surgical and oncological outcomes, and patient related outcome measures (PROMs) with different TM surgical procedures.

Results Patients were relatively young at a median age of 49 years with moderate-large breasts and grade II-III ptosis. Patients underwent simple (n=96), complex (n=79) or extreme TM (n=46). Low post-operative complication rates and good-excellent cosmetic scores were observed. With median follow-up of 26 months, 148 patients completed more than 1 year follow-up.

  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Introduction Therapeutic mammoplasty (TM) is a type of oncoplastic breast surgery (OBS) well suited to breast cancers in medium-large sized breasts with ptosis, and in some cases of large or multifocal/Multicentric (MF/MC) tumors. It includes contralateral symmetrisation. This report describes our experiences and outcomes of TM in breast cancer patients in a single institutional cohort in India.

Methods We present data for 207 cases (194 breast cancer, 13 benign disease) who underwent TM as part of their primary treatment. All patients underwent surgery after careful analysis of feasibility by a multidisciplanary tumor board and patient counselling. We report the clinicopathological profiles, surgical and oncological outcomes, and patient related outcome measures (PROMs) with different TM surgical procedures.

Results Patients were relatively young at a median age of 49 years with moderate-large breasts and grade II-III ptosis. Patients underwent simple (n=96), complex (n=79) or extreme TM (n=46). Low post-operative complication rates and good-excellent cosmetic scores were observed. With median follow-up of 26 months, 148 patients completed more than 1 year follow-up. The 1-year BREAST-Q PROMs revealed good-to-excellent scores for all types of therapeutic mammoplasty.

Conclusion We conclude that in a country where women present with large and locally advanced tumours, TM safely expands the indications for breast conservation surgery. PROMs scores show that this surgery is perceived to be physically and mentally satisfactory. With the popularization of this procedure, it is possible that more Indian patients with breast cancer will receive the benefits of breast conservation while maintaining their quality of life.

                              Therapeutic mammoplasty (TM) is a type of oncoplastic breast surgery (OBS) well suited to breast cancers in medium-large sized breasts with ptosis, and in some cases of large or multifocal/Multicentric (MF/MC) tumors. It includes contralateral symmetrisation. This report describes our experiences and outcomes of TM in breast cancer patients in a single institutional cohort in India.

                              We present data for 207 cases (194 breast cancer, 13 benign disease) who underwent TM as part of their primary treatment. All patients underwent surgery after careful analysis of feasibility by a multidisciplanary tumor board and patient counselling. We report the clinicopathological profiles, surgical and oncological outcomes, and patient related outcome measures (PROMs) with different TM surgical procedures.

                              Patients were relatively young at a median age of 49 years with moderate-large breasts and grade II-III ptosis. Patients underwent simple (n=96), complex (n=79) or extreme TM (n=46). Low post-operative complication rates and good-excellent cosmetic scores were observed. With median follow-up of 26 months, 148 patients completed more than 1 year follow-up. The 1-year BREAST-Q PROMs revealed good-to-excellent scores for all types of therapeutic mammoplasty.

                               Conclusion
                              </strong>
                              We conclude that in a country where women present with large and locally advanced tumours, TM safely expands the indications for breast conservation surgery. PROMs scores show that this surgery is perceived to be physically and mentally satisfactory. With the popularization of this procedure, it is possible that more Indian patients with breast cancer will receive the benefits of breast conservation while maintaining their quality of life.

If the patient consents for TM, simultaneous contralateral breast reduction is also discussed This option gives superior cosmetic outcomes for women with ptotic breasts (Grades I-III) and moderate-to-large sized breasts.

                               In the pre-operative planning, appropriate markings are made on both breasts based on a wise pattern or vertical scar incision. The nipple areolar complex (NAC) is re-positioned between 19-23 cm from the sternal notch, which is often determined by placing the fingers at the inframammary fold (IMF) and projecting on the anterior surface of the breast into the meridian.

In post-NACT cases, tumour is localized mid-NACT (at ∼ 1cm tumour size) by USG guided insertion of Liga clips (Koppiker et al., unpublished observations).

                               ). The wise pattern is located to excise the localized tumour with wide margins. The area of the appropriate pedicle which will carry the nipple is marked and de-epithelized. The tumor is then excised with wide margins through one of the limbs of the wise pattern. If required, further imaging of the specimen is performed using specimen mammography to ensure that the tumor is excised with wide margins The shaved margins of the cavity are further excised and sent for frozen sections to assess margin positivity. If any margins are close to the tumor (<0.5 cms), they are re-excised. Once negative tumor margins of the excision cavity are achieved the decision is made to use one of the appropriate pedicles.

If a tumor is present in outer quadrants (i.e., at 2, 3 or 4 O’ clock position of left breast or at 8, 9 or 10 O’clock positions of the right breast), dual pedicle technique is preferentially used. In this technique, the inferior pedicle fills up the gap and the NAC is positioned on a superior, superomedial or lateral pedicle. The main aim of the dual pedicle technique is to contour the defect with one pedicle and position the NAC on the other, thereby providing a dual vascular supply.

                             . India brings about its own challenges due to clinical, psychosocial and economic profiles of breast cancer patients being significantly different than western countries. We thus had to adapt our counselling methods for oncoplastic procedures like TM accordingly. Owing to financial and logistical challenges, Indian patients have reduced acceptance of a second operative procedure

                             . Therefore, we perform a single-step TM procedure that involves simultaneous reconstruction of the NAC and contralateral reduction mammoplasty for bilateral symmetrization in which the nipple may undergo resection with a NAC graft. If the patient does not consent for opposite symmetrization, alternative OBS procedures to TM are recommended.

                             TM-related decision-making algorithms are based on the tumor location and breast size. Most of the cases in our study cohort have been operated using the dual pedicle technique in which NAC was carried on superior pedicle and the inferior pedicle was used to fill the defect caused by excision of the tumor. In patients with smaller breasts or with large excisions, we have frequently used the whole lower segments of the breast (i.e., inferomedial and inferolateral pedicles) so the breast mound is advanced into the defect and NAC is reimplanted onto the pedicle.

                             Our cohort includes 24 (12.3%) patients who underwent an upfront extreme oncoplasty and 18 (9.2%) patients received NACT followed by extreme TM. In agreement with literature, we recorded a relatively low rate of overall complications. In a post-NACT cohort at our centre, TM was found to be an essential tool to increase the scope of BCS in patients who have large residual tumors (large excision volume). Interestingly, a large majority of the extreme TM performed in this NACT cohort would have qualified for mastectomy at presentation (Koppiker et al., unpublished observations). The potential advantage of TM is wide margins of excision, thus, achieving lower rates of re-excision

                             We also discuss representative cases from each type of surgery. Simple TM typically utilizes a single pedicle and is represented in Case 1 (Supp. Fig. 1). An extended inferior pedicle or a dual pedicle provide optimal outcomes in complex TM procedures (Case 2 and 3; Supp. Fig. 2 and 3). Extreme or split reduction TM is a suitable option for cases with large excisions which were otherwise indicated for mastectomy (Case Study #4; Supp. Fig. 4).

                             Our study represents the first detailed report on surgical, oncological and PROMs outcomes after TM surgery in breast cancer patients from India as observed in a single breast oncoplasty unit. We conclude that our TM technique(s) maybe suited for even advanced stage patients with moderate-to-large breasts with mild/severe ptosis. In general, our study observations are compliant with the guidelines of TeaM protocol except few non-compliances such as lack of MRI which has poor uptake in India due to cost barriers.

                             It may be inaccurate to extrapolate the study findings to the general Indian population due to the large variability in socio-cultural, psychological, and economical ground realities across the country. Similar TM-focused studies from other Indian breast units will be needed in future to corroborate the observations from our study. Indeed, protocols and surgical techniques established here along with PROMs would be a useful framework for replication by other breast surgeons. If the techniques and outcomes of OBS are popularized and the broad indications of TM are clearly defined, it is possible that more eligible breast cancer patients will receive the benefits of this procedure over the routine practice of mastectomy that is currently practiced.
