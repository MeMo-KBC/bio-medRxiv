  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Importance Recent changes in the Infectious Diseases and Healthcare Epidemiology Societies of America (IDSA-SHEA) guidelines for managing Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) have placed fidaxomicin as first-line treatment.

Objective To estimate the net cost of first line fidaxomicin compared to vancomycin in the American and Canadian healthcare systems and to estimate the price points at which fidaxomicin would become cost saving. In Canada, net costs were from the public payer perspective. In the US, costs were from a healthcare and payer perspective.

Data sources We identified all randomized controlled trials comparing fidaxomicin with vancomycin through the 2021 IDSA-SHEA guideline update. Medication costs were obtained from internet prices (US) and the Quebec drug formulary (Canada). The average cost of a CDI recurrence was established through a systematic review for each country.

Study selection For fidaxomicin efficacy, we included double-blind and placebo-controlled trials. For the systematic review of recurrence costs, studies were included if they were primary research articles, had a cost-analysis of CDI, included cases of recurrent CDI, and were calculated with cost parameters from American or Canadian healthcare systems. Studies were excluded if the population was solely pediatric or hospitalized.

Data extraction and Synthesis For the efficacy meta-analysis, data was pooled using a restricted maximal likelihood random effects model. For the cost review, the mean cost across identified studies was adjusted to reflect July 2022 dollars.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was CDI recurrence at Day 40. The primary outcome of the systematic review was the average cost of a CDI recurrence in the American and Canadian healthcare systems. The objective was to estimate the net cost per recurrence prevented and the price point below which fidaxomicin would be cost saving to either the public payer (Canada) or the insurer (US).

Results The estimated mean system cost of a CDI recurrence was $15147USD and $8806CAD, respectively. At current drug pricing, to prevent one recurrence by using first line fidaxomicin over vancomycin would cost $43904USD (95%CI $35123-$65856) and $13,760CAD (95%CI $11,008-$20,640), respectively. The likelihood of fidaxomicin offering cost savings varies by country, with a 95% probability of fidaxomicin being cost saving if priced below $1180USD or $860CAD respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance An increased drug expenditure on fidaxomicin will not be offset through recurrence prevention unless the fidaxomicin price is negotiated.

                              We identified all randomized controlled trials comparing fidaxomicin with vancomycin through the 2021 IDSA-SHEA guideline update. Medication costs were obtained from internet prices (US) and the Quebec drug formulary (Canada). The average cost of a CDI recurrence was established through a systematic review for each country.

                              For fidaxomicin efficacy, we included double-blind and placebo-controlled trials. For the systematic review of recurrence costs, studies were included if they were primary research articles, had a cost-analysis of CDI, included cases of recurrent CDI, and were calculated with cost parameters from American or Canadian healthcare systems. Studies were excluded if the population was solely pediatric or hospitalized.

                              The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was CDI recurrence at Day 40. The primary outcome of the systematic review was the average cost of a CDI recurrence in the American and Canadian healthcare systems. The objective was to estimate the net cost per recurrence prevented and the price point below which fidaxomicin would be cost saving to either the public payer (Canada) or the insurer (US).

                              The estimated mean system cost of a CDI recurrence was $15147USD and $8806CAD, respectively. At current drug pricing, to prevent one recurrence by using first line fidaxomicin over vancomycin would cost $43904USD (95%CI $35123-$65856) and $13,760CAD (95%CI $11,008-$20,640), respectively. The likelihood of fidaxomicin offering cost savings varies by country, with a 95% probability of fidaxomicin being cost saving if priced below $1180USD or $860CAD respectively.

                             . Of these, 15-20% represent recurrences. The prevention of incident and recurrent episodes of CDI is therefore an important public health goal. Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been investigated as initial treatment, and more specifically, to reduce risk of recurrence. For much of the twenty-first century, the recommended initial treatment of CDI has been oral metronidazole or vancomycin. In 2011, fidaxomicin was first demonstrated to be non-inferior to oral vancomycin for clinical cure

However, recommendations for fidaxomicin as first line therapy have lagged in guidelines and formulary uptake has been slow, presumably due to fidaxomicin’s higher cost.

At the current pricing, treating all American and Canadian patients with fidaxomicin would cost an estimated $2.79 billion US dollars (USD) and $60 million Canadian dollars (CAD) per year, respectively. Whether the reduction of recurrent CDI will offset the higher up-front cost of fidaxomicin is unknown. We sought to estimate: 1) the net (added) cost of first line use of fidaxomicin required to prevent a recurrence as compared to oral vancomycin and compare this with 2) the cost of a CDI recurrence so that we could determine 3) the price point where a treatment course with fidaxomicin becomes cost saving.

Is the US, we assumed cost would be to an insurer and/or patient, and in Canada, to the public payer. We searched PubMed on July 10, 2022, with the search terms described in the Supplement. We included studies that were primary research articles, contained a cost-analysis of CDI, included cases of recurrent CDI, and were calculated with cost parameters based on the American or Canadian healthcare systems. Studies were excluded if the population studied was solely pediatric or hospitalized patients. References for all included studies were examined for additional applicable studies. Screening and data extraction was performed in duplicate (DP, JS, and TCL) with disagreement resolved by consensus. All costs were converted to May 2022 dollars using the Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator

We created scatter plots of the probability of cost equivalence as a function of fidaxomicin price. For visualization purposes, a smooth line of best fit was generated with curvefit

                              The search for the cost of a recurrence in Canada yielded 123 results, of which 18 articles were reviewed based on the title and abstract. Of these 18 studies, 14 studies were excluded: 5 studies did not include cases of recurrent CDI, 4 studies did not measure the cost of CDI, 4 studies were literature reviews, and 1 study measured the cost of readmission to hospital due to CDI without specifying if it was for first episode or recurrence. Four remaining studies included cases of recurrent or relapsed CDI and their cost

                              With respect to the US, at the quoted price for 10 days of fidaxomicin and for 10 days of vancomycin capsules, there is a 0% chance that fidaxomicin will be cost equivalent by preventing the next CDI recurrence (

Therefore, fidaxomicin is very likely to be cost saving if priced below $1180 in the US. For Canada, at the current 10-day price of $1,580 CAD for fidaxomicin and $208 CAD for vancomycin, there is less than a 0.25% chance that fidaxomicin will be cost equivalent by preventing the next CDI recurrence (

Reducing fidaxomicin price to approximately $1,150 CAD [$950 more than the current cost of a 10-day course of vancomycin] the probability of cost equivalence rises to 50% and at approximately $860 CAD [$660 more than vancomycin] the probability rises to 95%. In Canada, at any price below $860 CAD, fidaxomicin is likely to be cost saving.

                             From our detailed review of the literature and associated calculations, we found that for both the US and Canada, the use of fidaxomicin as first-line treatment for CDI will cost substantially more to both the public payer in Canada and to US payers compared with potential cost savings through recurrence reduction. We identified price-points of approximately $1180 USD and $860 CAD at or below which the use of fidaxomicin is highly probable to be cost equivalent or cost saving. Despite double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial evidence that 10 days of fidaxomicin is superior to 10 days of vancomycin for the secondary outcome of prevention of first recurrence at day 40, this efficacy has not translated into a meaningful uptake of fidaxomicin which we hypothesize is due to this very high financial impact. In Canada, individual provinces have their own drug plans, and negotiation with the manufacturer to obtain a more cost-equivalent price point is possible, which could facilitate a financially viable practice change. In the US, such negotiations are generally currently permitted by Medicare by law; however, negotiation of pricing could save the US billions per year for all drugs, including fidaxomicin

                             This analysis has several limitations. At the current price of fidaxomicin, any strategy that increases the efficacy of vancomycin, for example, the use of an up-front decreasing dose taper to prevent recurrence (

                             ), would impact our results and would require recalculation. We have presented a best-case scenario for fidaxomicin by comparing it to a 10-day course of vancomycin. Furthermore, the efficacy of fidaxomicin to prevent recurrence at day 56 (the IDSA-SHEA definition of recurrence), or day 90, was not studied in the randomized trials. Up to 31% of recurrences may happen after day 42

                             and there is no RCT data to allow comparisons including delayed recurrences. Fidaxomicin treatment outcomes have not been properly studied in patients with multiple recurrences, but it is possible that preventing the first recurrence could reduce the risk of subsequent recurrence and therefore be more attractive. Also, US drug prices are not fully transparent, and the costs borne to different parts of the system (patient, insurance company, hospitals/facilities) are often unclear. We used publicly available data to estimate the costs, but these costs may not reflect the costs to each party. Finally, further reducing the cost of vancomycin through the compounding of generic IV vancomycin into liquid form or reducing the cost of other formulations would increase the break-even price of fidaxomicin.

                             The estimation of CDI recurrence cost through systematic review for each country also has some limitations. The articles from the US had differing cost perspectives, with half the articles having a payer perspective while the other half had a healthcare perspective. The time frame of both Canadian and US studies also differed, ranging from 6 weeks of a recurrence to up to 12 months from a recurrence, with some studies having an unspecified time frame.

                             A strength of our study is the use of a meta-analytic assessment of the effect size for fidaxomicin from all the placebo-controlled trials, coupled with a systematic estimate of recurrence costs to produce a practical and easily understood comparison. Comparing additional drug costs vs. an estimate of the cost of a recurrence is a different analytic perspective that that cost per quality adjusted life-year point of view. Previous cost-effectiveness studies have been done, most showing a trivial fractional difference (e.g., 0.03) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). More fundamentally, cost-effectiveness is not the same as cost saving. Cost-effectiveness measures, including cost per QALY and cost per incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), assess added costs by a subjectively perceived threshold of value. Often this is contextualized against the historical price for a year of hemodialysis, which is lifesaving. However, hospitals, patients, and governments do not have unlimited budgets and most treatments are not a crucially lifesaving as hemodialysis. Even if an intervention is perceived as valuable, if the cost is unsustainable, cost-effectiveness may be irrelevant whereas cost-equivalence or cost-saving compared to current effective therapies are always relevant.

                             CDI causes a major burden to health systems worldwide and reduction of recurrence has value. Yet, health system sustainability requires thoughtful assessment of both current and future costs and benefits. At current pricing, a switch to first line fidaxomicin will cost billions of excess healthcare dollars to Canadian and US payers and based on this analysis these costs will not be recouped through the reduction of recurrent CDI. Assuming vancomycin costs remain the same, and until additional trials of novel vancomycin dosing strategies are available, a reduction of the cost of fidaxomicin to below $1180USD and $860CAD respectively would support a substantial change to fidaxomicin prescribing practices.
