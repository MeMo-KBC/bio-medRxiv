  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Objective To examine whether racial/ethnic discrimination predicts future COVID-19 vaccine refusal, and whether this association is explained by trust in government and the health system.

Design Longitudinal observational study of racial/ethnic discrimination occurring since the start of the first lockdown (measured in July 2020) and later COVID-19 vaccine status.

Setting UK (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)

Participants 633 adults belonging to ethnic minority groups who took part in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study.

Main outcome measure COVID-19 vaccine refusal (vs accepted/waiting/had at least one dose) between 23 December 2020 and 14 June 2021.

Results Nearly one in ten (6.7%) who had refused a COVID-19 vaccine had experienced racial/ethnic discrimination in a medical setting since the start of the pandemic and had experienced twice as many incidents of racial/ethnic discrimination than those who had accepted the vaccine. Structural equation modelling results indicated a nearly 4-fold (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4 to 10.9) total effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on refusing the vaccine was which was mediated by low trust in the health system to handle the pandemic (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.4). Analyses adjusted for a range of demographic and COVID-19 related factors.

Conclusions Findings underscore the importance of addressing racial/ethnic discrimination and the role the National Health Service in regaining trust from ethnic minority groups to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake amongst ethnic minority adults.

                              Nearly one in ten (6.7%) who had refused a COVID-19 vaccine had experienced racial/ethnic discrimination in a medical setting since the start of the pandemic and had experienced twice as many incidents of racial/ethnic discrimination than those who had accepted the vaccine. Structural equation modelling results indicated a nearly 4-fold (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4 to 10.9) total effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on refusing the vaccine was which was mediated by low trust in the health system to handle the pandemic (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.4). Analyses adjusted for a range of demographic and COVID-19 related factors.

                             Despite the relative overall success of the UK’s vaccination programme, the differential uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is a cause for concern. The most recent data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey showed that as of 18 July 2021, vaccine uptake in eligible adults was lower in ethnic minority groups as a whole (80%) compared to White British (91%), particularly in people self-identifying as Black or Black British (68%), and in people of mixed ethnicity (79%).

                             Additionally, data show higher COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (a delay in acceptance or refusal of safe vaccines despite availability of vaccine services)

                             Further, large UK surveys of attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination have shown much greater proportions of vaccine hesitancy in some of these ethnic minority groups.

                             Qualitative research conducted with ethnic minority groups during the third UK lockdown also points to mistrust of government and public health bodies as a mediator between racial/ethnic discrimination and vaccine hesitancy.

                             Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have highlighted that the main reasons for COVID-19 hesitancy among ethnic minorities centre around trust, with Black ethnicities substantially more likely to state that they “don’t trust vaccines” compared with White people (29.2% vs 5.7%).

                             Lack of trust can be self-perpetuating as it can lead to lower participation in research amongst ethnic minority groups, in particular COVID-19 research.

                             However, these efforts have been insufficient to prevent inequalities in vaccine uptake. Therefore, more work is urgently needed to mitigate the unequal and severe effects of the pandemic on ethnic minority populations. The objective of this study is therefore to examine the longitudinal associations between experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination and COVID-19 vaccine refusal and explore whether low trust in government and the health system could explain this association. This work could help to guide future interventions to support vaccine uptake amongst ethnic minority groups.

                              We used data from the COVID-19 Social Study; a large ongoing panel study of the psychological and social experiences of over 70,000 adults (aged 18+) in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study commenced on 21 March 2020 and involves online weekly (to August 2020) then monthly (four-weekly) data collection for the duration of the pandemic. Sampling is not random and therefore is not representative of the UK population, but the study does contain a heterogeneous sample. The sample was recruited using three primary approaches. First, convenience sampling was used, including promoting the study through existing networks and mailing lists (such as large databases of adults who had previously consented to be involved in health research across the UK), print, and digital media coverage. Second, more targeted recruitment was undertaken focusing on (i) individuals from a low-income background, (ii) individuals with no or few educational qualifications, and (iii) individuals who were unemployed. Third, the study was promoted via partnerships with third sector organisations to vulnerable groups, including adults with pre-existing mental health conditions, older adults, carers, and people experiencing domestic violence or abuse.

We excluded participants if they had missing data on any study variables. A total of 36,883 had non-missing vaccination status data collected from 23 December 2020 onwards. Of these, 22,212 also had non-missing data on the discrimination module, which was administered the week of 23 to 30 July 2020, and 21,636 also had non-missing data on all other study variables. Of these, 712 responded at the baseline interview that they belonged to an ethnic minority group (Asian/Asian British - Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, other; Black/Black British - Caribbean, Africa; Mixed race - White and Black/Black British; mixed race-other; Chinese/Chinese British; Middle Eastern/Middle Eastern British – Arab, Turkish, other; or other ethnic group]). As our focus was on COVID-19 vaccine refusal versus acceptance, we eliminated the 79 ethnic minority group adults who met all other inclusion criteria but who had not yet been offered the vaccine, leaving a final sample of 633.

Our vaccination status outcome variable was constructed by classifying participants into one of two groups based on their most recent answers to these two questions: vaccinated (received at least one does or waiting) vs offered but declined.

                             This is the first study in the UK, to our knowledge, that finds longitudinal associations between racial/ethnic discrimination and COVID-19 vaccine refusal. The total effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on vaccine refusal was nearly four-fold. This echoes previous research showing associations between lifetime experiences of racial discrimination with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

                             Our study expands on previous research by showing that low trust in the health system mediates the relationship between racial/ethnic discrimination and vaccine refusal. Further, our findings confirm evidence before the current pandemic, which found associations between experiences of racial discrimination and distrust of the health care system

                             In this study, 6.7% of participants who had refused the vaccine reported they had experienced poorer service or treatment than other people in a medical setting because of their race or ethnicity. Research conducted before and during the pandemic also suggests that lifetime experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination in health care settings is commonplace. In June 2019, nearly 1 in 3 (30%) of non-Hispanic Black and over 1 in 10 (11%) Hispanic adults had ever been treated differently by a health care provider because of their race or ethnicity.

                             We examined the total number of racial/ethnic discrimination experiences in relation to vaccine refusal and it was low trust in the health system, and not the central UK government, to handle the pandemic that mediated the association between discrimination and vaccine refusal. Research, in mostly White participants, has found similar associations between low trust in the health system, not central government, and negative attitudes towards vaccines, in particular COVID-19 vaccination.

                             Strengths of this study include a longitudinal design and a large sample size that includes a diverse group of UK ethnic minority adults from different age, gender, socioeconomic status, and geographical locations. Although data were weighted to increase representativeness of the general UK population, sampling was not random, and caution should therefore be used in generalising results. Notably, the proportion of ethnic minority adults in our study who had refused the COVID-19 vaccine was less than half that reported by the ONS (4.1% vs 9%).

                             Due to the small number of participants within specific ethnic minority groups in our sample, we examined ethnic minority groups as a whole in our analyses, which does not account for the variation in the current and historical experiences of discrimination, as well as any underlying differences in reasons for vaccine hesitancy due to age, sex, and education across these diverse groups.

                             Further, due to limitations in question phrasing (i.e.,‘White-British, Irish, other’), we were unable to examine associations between study variables and vaccine refusal in White subgroups, some of whom have also had lower COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

                             The most common ethnic group in those who had refused the vaccine was the ‘other ethnic group’. Similarly, nearly one in ten (7.4%) in the total sample said they had experienced some ‘other’ form of discrimination related to their race or ethnicity. Future research should therefore provide participants with opportunities to write in their identified ethnic group and specify other types of racial discrimination experienced. Furthermore, future studies should collect information on the frequency of racial/ethnic discrimination to gain understanding of the extent and magnitude of the experiences of daily discrimination. Finally, another limitation of the current study is that we measured trust in government and the health service, and not mistrust, the latter of which implies beliefs that institutions are actively behaving in contradiction of one’s best interests.

These findings indicate that it is vital that healthcare institutions such as the NHS work to gain the confidence and trust of ethnic minority groups. Furthermore, public health campaigns to increase COVID-19 uptake in ethnic minorities should include not only trust-building in vaccines, but also strategies to prevent racial discrimination and support ethnic minorities who have experienced discrimination.
