Extensive global participation has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report, our 17th report, is a part of a series published over the past 2 years. Data have been entered for 800,459 individuals from 1701 partner institutions and networks across 60 countries.

The comprehensive analyses detailed in this report includes hospitalised individuals of all ages for whom data collection occurred between 30 January 2020 and up to and including 5 January 2022, AND who have laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection or clinically diagnosed COVID-19.

Extensive global participation has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report, our 17th report, is a part of a series published over the past 2 years. Data have been entered for 800,459 individuals from 1701 partner institutions and networks across 60 countries.

The comprehensive analyses detailed in this report includes hospitalised individuals of all ages for whom data collection occurred between 30 January 2020 and up to and including 5 January 2022, AND who have laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection or clinically diagnosed COVID-19.

### Author Declarations

I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

Yes

The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:

Ethics Committee approval for this work was given by the World Health Organisation Ethics Review Committee (RPC571 and RPC572 on 25 April 2013). Institutional approval was additionally obtained by participating sites including the South Central Oxford C Research Ethics Committee in England (Ref 13/SC/0149) and the Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (Ref 20/SS/0028) for the United Kingdom and the Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical) at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa as part of a national surveillance programme (M160667) collectively representing the majority of the data. Other institutional and national approvals are in place as per local requirements.

I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.

Yes

I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).

Yes

I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.

Yes

                             ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium) partnerships and outbreak preparedness initiatives enabled the rapid launch of standardised clinical data collection on COVID-19 in Jan 2020. Extensive global participation has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report, our 17th report, is a part of a series published over the past 2 years. Data have been entered for 800,459 individuals from 1701 partner institutions and networks across 60 countries.

                             After over 458 million cases and over 6 million deaths, COVID-19 is clearly showing us how pandemics disrupt populations by stretching healthcare systems, and shaking economies. Although clinicians and well-equipped surveillance systems can adapt to health emergencies by implementing new treatments and information systems, clinical research lacks this agility.

                              Novel diseases are, by definition, new; the scientific method is not. By developing consensus on a road map for clinical research methods before a pandemic, we are able to minimise further time defining study types, data collection tools, and potential outputs for evidence summarisation once the pathogen emerges. Using slightly adjusted standardised methods for novel diseases, evidence can be generated quickly.

                              While small observational studies are easy to conduct, they often record different data or may record variables in different ways. This may not allow data to be collated or findings to be compared across studies, or combined to produce a more powerful and accurate representation. In contrast, large international observational studies with a standardised form allow for international data comparisons, improved analytic control of confounders, and therefore enable the acquisition of high levels of evidence.

Today, our partners have collected standardised, in-hospital clinical data from over 800,000 patients, in 1701 sites, across 60 countries. More than half of these patients live in low- and middle-income countries. This partner-fueled initiative is to our knowledge the largest COVID-19 in-hospital international database in the world.

Then, our clinical team provides feedback on clinical relevance and overlap with other analyses. Once this process has been completed, the SAP is sent to all ISARIC collaborators for the opportunity to review. This initial peer review process ensures that research is of the utmost quality and it helps encourage a truly participatory approach.

The outputs of our joint work are disseminated as widely as possible to inform patient care and public health policy. ISARIC aims to include the names of all those who contribute data in the cited authorship of publications, subject to the submission of contact details and confirmation of acceptance of the final manuscript within the required timelines, per ICMJE policies and the ISARIC publication policy.

                              Using the ISARIC and ISARIC4C databases, our partners have produced a broad range of evidence. More than 50 reports and manuscripts have been published to date, and a further 25 are in progress or under peer-review.
