  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background and Aim Lymphatic vessels (LVs) are crucial for maintaining abdominal fluid homeostasis and immunity. In liver cirrhosis, mesenteric LVs (mLVs) are dilated and dysfunctional. Given an established protective role of VEGF-C in LVs, we hypothesized that VEGF-C treatment could improve functions of mLVs in cirrhosis.

Method In this study, we developed a nanoformulation comprising LV-specific growth-factor, recombinant human VEGF-C(Cys156Ser) protein(E-VEGF-C) and delivered it orally in rat models of liver cirrhosis to target mLVs. Nanoformulation without VEGF-C served as vehicle. Drainage of mLVs was analyzed using tracer dye. Portal and systemic physiological assessments and computed-tomography were performed to measure portal pressures and ascites. Gene expression of mesenteric lymphatic endothelial cells (LyECs) was studied. Immune cell subsets in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were quantified by flow-cytometry. Gut bacterial translocation to MLNs was examined using GFP-labelled bacteria.

Results In cirrhotic rats, mLVs were dilated and leaky with impaired drainage. Treatment with E-VEGF-C induced proliferation of VEGFR3+ mLVs, reduced their diameter and improved functional drainage. Ascites and portal pressures were significantly reduced in E-VEGF-C treated rats compared to vehicle. At molecular level, E-VEGF-C treatment upregulated the expression of cell adhesion and permeability genes (VCAM1, VE-Cad) in LyECs. In MLNs of E-VEGF-C rats, there was an increased percentage of CD8+CD134+ T-cells and decreased CD25+Treg-cells. Bacterial translocation was also limited to MLNs only in E-VEGF-C treated rats with reduced levels of endotoxins in ascites in comparison to vehicle.

Conclusion E-VEGF-C treatment ameliorates mesenteric lymph drainage, portal pressure, and strengthens cytotoxic immune responses in MLNs in experimental cirrhosis. It may thus serve as a promising therapy to manage ascites and portal pressure and reduce gut bacterial translocation in patients with cirrhosis.

Lay Summary A human recombinant pro-lymphangiogenic growth factor, VEGF-C, was encapsulated in nanolipocarriers (E-VEGF-C) and orally delivered in rat models of decompensated liver cirrhosis to facilitate its gut lymphatic vessel uptake. E-VEGF-C administration significantly increased mesenteric lymphatic vessel proliferation and improved lymph drainage, attenuating abdominal ascites and portal pressures in the animal models. E-VEGF-C treatment limits bacterial translocation to MLNs only with reduced gut bacterial load and ascitic endotoxins. E-VEGF-C therapy holds the potential to manage ascites and portal pressure and reduce gut bacterial translocation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background and Aim Lymphatic vessels (LVs) are crucial for maintaining abdominal fluid homeostasis and immunity. In liver cirrhosis, mesenteric LVs (mLVs) are dilated and dysfunctional. Given an established protective role of VEGF-C in LVs, we hypothesized that VEGF-C treatment could improve functions of mLVs in cirrhosis.

Method In this study, we developed a nanoformulation comprising LV-specific growth-factor, recombinant human VEGF-C(Cys156Ser) protein(E-VEGF-C) and delivered it orally in rat models of liver cirrhosis to target mLVs. Nanoformulation without VEGF-C served as vehicle. Drainage of mLVs was analyzed using tracer dye. Portal and systemic physiological assessments and computed-tomography were performed to measure portal pressures and ascites. Gene expression of mesenteric lymphatic endothelial cells (LyECs) was studied. Immune cell subsets in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were quantified by flow-cytometry. Gut bacterial translocation to MLNs was examined using GFP-labelled bacteria.

Results In cirrhotic rats, mLVs were dilated and leaky with impaired drainage. Treatment with E-VEGF-C induced proliferation of VEGFR3+ mLVs, reduced their diameter and improved functional drainage. Ascites and portal pressures were significantly reduced in E-VEGF-C treated rats compared to vehicle. At molecular level, E-VEGF-C treatment upregulated the expression of cell adhesion and permeability genes (VCAM1, VE-Cad) in LyECs. In MLNs of E-VEGF-C rats, there was an increased percentage of CD8+CD134+ T-cells and decreased CD25+Treg-cells. Bacterial translocation was also limited to MLNs only in E-VEGF-C treated rats with reduced levels of endotoxins in ascites in comparison to vehicle.

Conclusion E-VEGF-C treatment ameliorates mesenteric lymph drainage, portal pressure, and strengthens cytotoxic immune responses in MLNs in experimental cirrhosis. It may thus serve as a promising therapy to manage ascites and portal pressure and reduce gut bacterial translocation in patients with cirrhosis.

Lay Summary A human recombinant pro-lymphangiogenic growth factor, VEGF-C, was encapsulated in nanolipocarriers (E-VEGF-C) and orally delivered in rat models of decompensated liver cirrhosis to facilitate its gut lymphatic vessel uptake. E-VEGF-C administration significantly increased mesenteric lymphatic vessel proliferation and improved lymph drainage, attenuating abdominal ascites and portal pressures in the animal models. E-VEGF-C treatment limits bacterial translocation to MLNs only with reduced gut bacterial load and ascitic endotoxins. E-VEGF-C therapy holds the potential to manage ascites and portal pressure and reduce gut bacterial translocation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

                              </strong>
                              Lymphatic vessels (LVs) are crucial for maintaining abdominal fluid homeostasis and immunity. In liver cirrhosis, mesenteric LVs (mLVs) are dilated and dysfunctional. Given an established protective role of VEGF-C in LVs, we hypothesized that VEGF-C treatment could improve functions of mLVs in cirrhosis.

                              </strong>
                              In this study, we developed a nanoformulation comprising LV-specific growth-factor, recombinant human VEGF-C(Cys156Ser) protein(E-VEGF-C) and delivered it orally in rat models of liver cirrhosis to target mLVs. Nanoformulation without VEGF-C served as vehicle. Drainage of mLVs was analyzed using tracer dye. Portal and systemic physiological assessments and computed-tomography were performed to measure portal pressures and ascites. Gene expression of mesenteric lymphatic endothelial cells (LyECs) was studied. Immune cell subsets in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were quantified by flow-cytometry. Gut bacterial translocation to MLNs was examined using GFP-labelled bacteria.

                              In cirrhotic rats, mLVs were dilated and leaky with impaired drainage. Treatment with E-VEGF-C induced proliferation of VEGFR3+ mLVs, reduced their diameter and improved functional drainage. Ascites and portal pressures were significantly reduced in E-VEGF-C treated rats compared to vehicle. At molecular level, E-VEGF-C treatment upregulated the expression of cell adhesion and permeability genes (VCAM1, VE-Cad) in LyECs. In MLNs of E-VEGF-C rats, there was an increased percentage of CD8+CD134+ T-cells and decreased CD25+Treg-cells. Bacterial translocation was also limited to MLNs only in E-VEGF-C treated rats with reduced levels of endotoxins in ascites in comparison to vehicle.

                              E-VEGF-C treatment ameliorates mesenteric lymph drainage, portal pressure, and strengthens cytotoxic immune responses in MLNs in experimental cirrhosis. It may thus serve as a promising therapy to manage ascites and portal pressure and reduce gut bacterial translocation in patients with cirrhosis.

                              </strong>
                              A human recombinant pro-lymphangiogenic growth factor, VEGF-C, was encapsulated in nanolipocarriers (E-VEGF-C) and orally delivered in rat models of decompensated liver cirrhosis to facilitate its gut lymphatic vessel uptake. E-VEGF-C administration significantly increased mesenteric lymphatic vessel proliferation and improved lymph drainage, attenuating abdominal ascites and portal pressures in the animal models. E-VEGF-C treatment limits bacterial translocation to MLNs only with reduced gut bacterial load and ascitic endotoxins. E-VEGF-C therapy holds the potential to manage ascites and portal pressure and reduce gut bacterial translocation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

In non-cirrhotic model of portal hypertension, PPVL rats were prepared and randomized into two groups: (1) PPVL vehicle and PPVL+E-VEGF-C. In the PPVL+vehicle group, the RMs was administered orally on alternate days for 2 weeks after one week of surgery.

After 2hrs., mesentery tissue was isolated and optically cleared using methyl salicylate. Images of mesenteric lymphatic drainage were obtained using confocal microscopy at 10X (Leica SP8). Six fields from each slide were randomly selected, and photographs were taken. Lymphatic drainage was quantified by measuring BODIPY fluorescence intensity inside the LVs using ImageJ. LVs leakage was quantified by measuring BODIPY fluorescence intensity in vicinity of LVs using ImageJ. Diameter of the mLVs were calculated using ImageJ diameter plugin.

In control rats, thin LVs of diameter ranging from 50 to 80μm were observed, which were increased to 100 to 150μm in CCl4-V rats. In E-VEGF-C treated rats, sprouting of new LVs from the existing one was clearly observed with reduced diameter ranging from 60 to 100μm compared to the CCl4-V rats (

Collecting LVs generally present in mesentery, prevents any leakage of lymph by zippering between LyECs using VE-cadherin and VCAM-1. mRNA levels of VCAM1 decreases in LyECs of CCL4-V rats, indicating leaky mLVs causing more inflammation. No significant change was observed in VE-cadherin in CCl4-V rats compared to control. Treatment with E-VEGF-C led to increased expression of both VCAM1 and VE-cadherin in LyECs correlating with decreased leakage of lymph from mLVs (p<0.05). LyECs also act as APCs, present Ag to T cells for tolerance or induction of immune response. Costimulatory marker, CD86, was also significantly upregulated in LyECs of treated rats. In contrast, no significant change was observed in MHC-II levels in vehicle vs. treated group (p>0.05). The inflammatory marker COX2 was markedly increased in LyECs of CCl4-V rats suggesting inflamed lymphatic endothelium, which further reduced in LyECs of treated group (p<0.05). CCL21 and CCL19 chemokine mRNA level is found to be increased in LyECs of E-VEGF-C treated rats compared to vehicle resulting in increased immune cell trafficking to MLNs (p<0.05). PD-L1 was increased in LyECs of CCl4-V rats which further reduced in treated group (p<0.01).

                             In this study, we investigated morphological and molecular alterations of mLVs and MLNs in experimental cirrhosis and portal hypertension and reported significantly increased number of dilated pdpn+ and VEGFR3+ leaky mLVs with reduced drainage capacity and enhanced inflammatory markers in cirrhotic and portal hypertensive rats clearly implying gut lymphatic dysfunction similar to that observed in intestinal lymphangiectasia and gut inflammatory disorders[

A previous study in cirrhotic rats documented an increased expression of eNOS in mesenteric LyECs as the cause of dysfunctional lymphatics in cirrhosis and that inhibiting eNOS improved the lymphatic transport of the existing vessels by increasing the contractile activity of these vessels[

RM nano-lipocarriers are nanoparticle-sized water-in-oil microemulsions with controlled particle sizes. A recent report illustrated the therapeutic potential of the fully human fusion protein F8-VEGF-C for targeted delivery of VEGF-C in mouse models of chronic inflammatory skin disease[

First, the use of RM-based lipid nanocarriers allowed VEGF-C cargo to be carried in chylomicron-sized particles in LVs after oral delivery. Encapsulation also ensured their sustained and programmable release[

                             ]. In vitro uptake assays clearly showed more than 90% uptake of E-VEGF-C by mesenteric LyECs. In vitro release studies indicated more than 80% VEGF-C release in about 4hrs. and in vivo the release profile showed biphasic peak, with the initial burst coming at approximately 10 min, and the second peak at about 5 hrs. Biphasic drug release is a characteristic feature of drugs encapsulated in nano-lipocarriers[

                             ]. In in vivo biodistribution studies as well, cirrhotic rats showed maximum expression of VEGF-C in mesentery, indicating the efficacy of our delivery vehicle. We did not follow any conjugation chemistry for the preparation of E-VEGF-C molecule, rather, we focused on preparation of simple solid lipid nanoparticles with an aqueous template using a modified multiple emulsification technique[

                             Treatment with E-VEGF-C markedly enhanced the expression of VEGF-C protein in the mesentery, along with a concomitant increase in the sprouting of pdpn+ and VEGFR3+LVs both in the mesentery and MLNs, suggestive of VEGF-C driven proliferation of LyECs[

                             ]. The dilations observed in mLVs of cirrhotic rats were also attenuated with E-VEGF-C treatment. Specific genes, such as Prox1 and LyVE1, were significantly increased in the mesenteric LyECs of E-VEGF-C rats, indicating pronounced differentiation and proliferation of LyECs. Expression of inflammatory genes, such as Cox2, was decreased, while VCAM-1 and VE-cadherin, which govern cell adhesion and vessel permeability, increased in E-VEGF-C rats. The functional implications of enhanced gene expression were evident in terms of reduced inflammation, lymph leakage, and improved drainage in E-VEGF-C treated rats. This is in accordance with many previous studies showing the drainage-promoting function of VEGF-C in experimental models of bacterial skin inflammation and IBD[

                             ]. An improvement in lymphatic drainage and functionality of the mLVs in cirrhotic rats was also associated with marked reduction in ascitic fluid volume in rats. Decrease in ascites was accompanied by an increase in plasma volume of treated rats, suggesting that ascites may have been reabsorbed into the circulating blood[

                             Along with a reduction in ascites, there was also a significant decrease in PP in cirrhotic portal hypertensive rats treated with E-VEGF-C, which was associated with attenuated PBF and increased MAP. However, there was no change in IHR, indicating that improvement in PBF and not hepatic resistance (fibrosis) led to an improvement in portal pressure after treatment. It has been postulated that the removal of ascites plays role in postparacentesis systemic hemodynamic changes through mechanical decompression of the splanchnic vascular bed[

                             ]. However, it is plausible that a reduction in PP due to an increase in number of LVs and decrease in interstitial fluid pressure may also have led to decrease in ascites[

                             ]. Intriguingly, this decrease in PP was also observed in the non-cirrhotic PPVL animals after E-VEGF-C treatment, validating favorable effects of VEGF-C on PBF and systemic hemodynamics. An improvement in PP was not associated with a significant improvement in liver pathology in the treated rats, indicating that there were no protective effects of E-VEGF-C treatment on hepatic compartment per se. We also did not observe any major changes in the serum albumin or ALT levels in the treated animals. In our study, we administered therapeutic E-VEGF-C treatment in decompensated animal models when liver cirrhosis and ascites had already been established. It would be worthwhile to evaluate the effects of E-VEGF-C on early onset of decompensation and liver pathology in compensated cirrhotic models of portal hypertension using a preventive treatment approach.

                             To note, we did not detect any significant changes in the density of CD31+blood-vessels in E-VEGF-C-treated cirrhotic rats, indicating that LV-specific VEGF-C(Cys156Ser) did not affect mesenteric blood-vessels and was specific only to mLVs as previously demonstrated[

In cirrhotic animals treated with E-VEGF-C, bacteria remained confined to the MLNs only, with a significant increase in recently activated CD4 T cells, suggesting an appropriate immune response in their MLNs. An earlier study documented that the stimulation of cardiac lymphangiogenesis with VEGF-C improved the trafficking of immune cells to the draining lymph nodes after myocardial infarction resolving inflammation[

Gut LVs-targeted delivery of E-VEGF-C may open new and exciting avenues for the treatment and even prevention of decompensation in cirrhosis.
