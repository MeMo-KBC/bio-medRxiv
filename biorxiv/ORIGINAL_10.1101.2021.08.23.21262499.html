  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Rapid antigen (RA) tests are being increasingly employed to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in quarantine and surveillance. Prior research has focused on RT-PCR testing, a single RA test, or generic diagnostic characteristics of RA tests in assessing testing strategies.

Methods For 18 RA tests with emergency use authorization from the United States of America FDA and an RT-PCR test, we conducted a comparative analysis of the post-quarantine transmission, the effective reproduction number during serial testing, and the false-positive rates. To quantify the extent of transmission, we developed an analytical mathematical framework informed by COVID-19 infectiousness, test specificity, and temporal diagnostic sensitivity data.

Results We demonstrate that the relative effectiveness of RA and RT-PCR tests in reducing post-quarantine transmission depends on the quarantine duration and the turnaround time of testing results. For quarantines of two days or shorter, conducting a RA test on exit from quarantine reduces onward transmission more than a single RT-PCR test (with a 24-h delay) conducted upon exit. Applied to a complementary approach of performing serial testing at a specified frequency paired with isolation of positives, we have shown that RA tests outperform RT-PCR with a 24-h delay. The results from our modeling framework are consistent with quarantine and serial testing data collected from a remote industry setting.

Conclusions These RA test-specific results are an important component of the tool set for policy decision-making, and demonstrate that judicious selection of an appropriate RA test can supply a viable alternative to RT-PCR in efforts to control the spread of disease.

Plain language summary Previous research has determined optimal timing for testing in quarantine and the utility of different frequencies of testing for disease surveillance using RT-PCR and generalized rapid antigen tests.

However, these strategies can depend on the specific rapid antigen test used. By examining 18 rapid antigen tests, we demonstrate that a single rapid antigen test performs better than RT-PCR when quarantines are two days or less in duration. In the context of disease surveillance, the ability of a rapid antigen test to provide results quickly counteracts its lower sensitivity with potentially more false positives. These analytical results based on highly controlled test validation were consistent with real-world data obtained from quarantine and serial testing in an industrial setting.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background Rapid antigen (RA) tests are being increasingly employed to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in quarantine and surveillance. Prior research has focused on RT-PCR testing, a single RA test, or generic diagnostic characteristics of RA tests in assessing testing strategies.

Methods For 18 RA tests with emergency use authorization from the United States of America FDA and an RT-PCR test, we conducted a comparative analysis of the post-quarantine transmission, the effective reproduction number during serial testing, and the false-positive rates. To quantify the extent of transmission, we developed an analytical mathematical framework informed by COVID-19 infectiousness, test specificity, and temporal diagnostic sensitivity data.

Results We demonstrate that the relative effectiveness of RA and RT-PCR tests in reducing post-quarantine transmission depends on the quarantine duration and the turnaround time of testing results. For quarantines of two days or shorter, conducting a RA test on exit from quarantine reduces onward transmission more than a single RT-PCR test (with a 24-h delay) conducted upon exit. Applied to a complementary approach of performing serial testing at a specified frequency paired with isolation of positives, we have shown that RA tests outperform RT-PCR with a 24-h delay. The results from our modeling framework are consistent with quarantine and serial testing data collected from a remote industry setting.

Conclusions These RA test-specific results are an important component of the tool set for policy decision-making, and demonstrate that judicious selection of an appropriate RA test can supply a viable alternative to RT-PCR in efforts to control the spread of disease.

Plain language summary Previous research has determined optimal timing for testing in quarantine and the utility of different frequencies of testing for disease surveillance using RT-PCR and generalized rapid antigen tests.

However, these strategies can depend on the specific rapid antigen test used. By examining 18 rapid antigen tests, we demonstrate that a single rapid antigen test performs better than RT-PCR when quarantines are two days or less in duration. In the context of disease surveillance, the ability of a rapid antigen test to provide results quickly counteracts its lower sensitivity with potentially more false positives. These analytical results based on highly controlled test validation were consistent with real-world data obtained from quarantine and serial testing in an industrial setting.

                              Rapid antigen (RA) tests are being increasingly employed to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in quarantine and surveillance. Prior research has focused on RT-PCR testing, a single RA test, or generic diagnostic characteristics of RA tests in assessing testing strategies.

                              For 18 RA tests with emergency use authorization from the United States of America FDA and an RT-PCR test, we conducted a comparative analysis of the post-quarantine transmission, the effective reproduction number during serial testing, and the false-positive rates. To quantify the extent of transmission, we developed an analytical mathematical framework informed by COVID-19 infectiousness, test specificity, and temporal diagnostic sensitivity data.

                              We demonstrate that the relative effectiveness of RA and RT-PCR tests in reducing post-quarantine transmission depends on the quarantine duration and the turnaround time of testing results. For quarantines of two days or shorter, conducting a RA test on exit from quarantine reduces onward transmission more than a single RT-PCR test (with a 24-h delay) conducted upon exit. Applied to a complementary approach of performing serial testing at a specified frequency paired with isolation of positives, we have shown that RA tests outperform RT-PCR with a 24-h delay. The results from our modeling framework are consistent with quarantine and serial testing data collected from a remote industry setting.

                              These RA test-specific results are an important component of the tool set for policy decision-making, and demonstrate that judicious selection of an appropriate RA test can supply a viable alternative to RT-PCR in efforts to control the spread of disease.

                              However, these strategies can depend on the specific rapid antigen test used. By examining 18 rapid antigen tests, we demonstrate that a single rapid antigen test performs better than RT-PCR when quarantines are two days or less in duration. In the context of disease surveillance, the ability of a rapid antigen test to provide results quickly counteracts its lower sensitivity with potentially more false positives. These analytical results based on highly controlled test validation were consistent with real-world data obtained from quarantine and serial testing in an industrial setting.

                             Although the RT-PCR tests remain the gold standard for diagnosis, RA tests have aided in scaling up testing capacities worldwide. The fast turnaround time, wider availability, and lower costs make RA tests an attractive choice for workplace screening, especially in remote environments (e.g. offshore shift teams). The RA test kits require minimal training and can be self-administered, without requiring significant ongoing equipment maintenance and calibration.

Therefore, we present serial testing data for an offshore oil site as there is currently minimal published evidence of the effectiveness of large-scale serial RA testing in mitigating outbreaks within an industrial setting.

                             However, increasing the number of tests used in screening increases costs and elevates the number of false positives obtained. False-positive results do not entail direct epidemiological risks, but do lead to undesirable logistical and cost challenges. For example, in an offshore and or remote workplace setting, a false positive could necessitate medical evacuation via helicopter or other aviation platforms. From a workplace risk-analysis perspective, a false positive is less disruptive to operations than false negatives resulting in transmission and a full-scale outbreak.

                             Here we construct the temporal diagnostic sensitivity curves for 18 RA tests that have received EUA using data on percent positive agreement (PPA) with an RT-PCR test and temporal diagnostic sensitivity of an RT-PCR test. To determine when these RA tests can serve as a suitable alternative to the more costly and laborious RT-PCR tests, we calculated (i) their associated probabilities of post-quarantine transmission (PQT) for quarantine durations from one to 14 days with testing on exit or both entry and exit upon random entry into quarantine; (ii) their extents of onward transmission for serial testing conducted every day to every 14 days; and (iii) their associated probabilities of false-positives during serial testing. We further evaluated the utility of RA tests using data collected from two offshore oil companies in the context of quarantine and serial testing within an industrial environment.

For each testing frequency f (i.e., the time between two consecutive tests), we investigated the sequence of test times {1, 1 + f, 1 + 2f,…, 1 + 13f } that comprises all the unique testing patterns possible over a two-week period to calculate the average probability. Defining RT-PCR to be the gold standard for testing accuracy, the specificity of a RA test was estimated as the specificity of the RT-PCR test multiplied by the percent negative agreement of the RA test with RT-PCR. This calculation provides a lower bound for the RA test specificity, given the possibility of a false-negative RT-PCR test.

There is also uncertainty in the inferred diagnostic sensitivity in the later stages of disease, as the PPA was extrapolated past the last recorded data point for all RA tests. To address whether differences in the results of these tests among low levels of infectivity make a difference to our findings, we imposed a threshold on the level of infectivity such that the RA test will only return a negative. If the infectivity at the time of the RA tests is below the infectivity at 10 days post-symptom onset then the RA test returns a negative result (

To assess the sensitivity of our results to variation in the proportion of asymptomatic infection and the basic reproduction number, we conducted a grid analysis with values ranging from 0.1–0.95 and 1.05–5, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated an alternative model for the temporal RT-PCR diagnostic sensitivity curve, substituting a log-Student’s-t distribution for the log-Normal distribution used in the baseline analysis.

                              The BD Veritor kit was selected by BP/BHP because at the time it was possible to secure a sufficient volume of the test kits and readers for a potential six-month evaluation. With informed consent from the offshore oil workers, onshore paired testing was conducted by laboratory-based RT-PCR and RA testing on entry into quarantine (day 0), day three, and day four. For both RA and RT-PCR testing, swabbing within quarantine was conducted by medical personnel. The study period spanned 22 November 2020 to 17 January 2021, a period that included an observed rise in community transmission across Texas and Louisiana, the states of residence for the majority of the offshore platform workers.

                              Before entry into quarantine, workers had to pass a pre-screening questionnaire that filtered symptomatic individuals and those with recent exposure. During quarantine, a positive RT-PCR led to removal of the individual from the quarantine environment, placing them in isolation for 10 days with medical follow-up. Workers were then approved to return to work after two negative RT-PCR tests.

                              Implementation of a test-and-fly protocol began at the start of the staged vaccination rollout in the USA—2 March 2021 to 22 May 2021. Thus, none of the offshore workers were vaccinated nor likely to be vaccinated for several months. The test-and fly-strategy consisted of initial screening for symptoms, an RT-PCR test on entry to a quarantine of approximately 24 h. The exact quarantine duration was dependent on the commercial laboratory-based RT-PCR turnaround time: after receiving a negative RT-PCR test, the worker was permitted to enter the offshore work environment. With an RT-PCR positive test, the individual was removed from the quarantine environment, and advised to conduct a 10-day home-based self-isolation with medical follow-up.

                              Upon entering the offshore work environment, the worker underwent serial antigen testing within their first nine of 14 or more days being offshore.

The two patterns were selected based on the results from our data-driven model for the degree of suppression achieved at each frequency of testing, by the BD Veritor test kit (

Any positive individual was isolated pending helicopter transfer (typically within 12–24 hours) to the established onshore medical facility, whereupon an RT-PCR nasal swab was obtained and sent to a commercial laboratory. A positive antigen test was considered to be a false positive if the follow-up RT-PCR was negative.

We found that a probability of PQT equivalent to the CDC-suggested quarantine and testing strategy could be achieved using RA tests with at most a one-day increase to the quarantine duration. Equivalent durations to a seven-day quarantine with an RT-PCR test conducted 24 h before exit ranged from six to seven (95% CrI: 6–7) days when a RA test was conducted on both entry and on exit from quarantine (

Evaluating the importance of turnaround time for RT-PCR tests, we found that any significant delay has a substantial impact on the required frequency of serial testing. Specifying no delay in turnaround time, RT-PCR tests can be performed just once every three (95% CrI: 2–3) days. Turnaround times for RT-PCR are highly variable both in the USA and internationally with a 12–24 hour delay being common in the USA; however, delays of up to five days have been experienced by some companies in some non-USA locations. A 24-h turnaround time leads to an R

                              ). This improved performance of RT-PCR for the alternative incubation period can be attributed to a lower average probability of identifying a case in the incubation period (0.487, 95% CrI: 0.421–0.521; vs 0.704, 95% CrI: 0.609–0.724) and to the greater proportion of transmission occurring after the incubation period (44.9% vs 37.1%). With the reduced ability in general to detect a case early in the disease time course, the addition of a RA test upon entry into quarantine provides only a marginal reduction to the PQT. For six of the 18 RA tests, the alternative incubation period necessitates an increase in frequency of testing (from every three days to every two days) to maintain R

                              Our sensitivity curves for the RA tests featured very small but nonzero probabilities of false positive results very late in the disease time course. To assess whether these small but nonzero probabilities are having a significant effect on our results, we examined a scenario in which the RA test only returned negative results at levels of infectivity below the infectivity estimated at 10 days after symptom onset. This change had no effect on our results (

                              ). To explore the impact of an even narrower period in which a RA test can return a positive result, we imposed a higher threshold (i.e., the level of infectivity on 5.6 days after symptom onset) below which a negative result was assured. This threshold exhibited only a moderate effect on the optimal testing strategies for some of the more effective RA tests. Specifically, the duration of quarantine needed to be extended by one day for four RA tests (CareStart (NS); Celltrion DiaTrust; LumiraDX (AS); Simoa) to achieve a probability of PQT equivalent or lower than a 7-day quarantine with an RT-PCR test on exit. In the context of serial testing, five RA tests (Clip COVID; Liaison (AS); Samoa; Sofia; Sofia 2 Flu + SARS) required the time interval between tests to be shortened by one day (i.e., more frequent testing;

                             Our study demonstrates the utility of RT-PCR and RA tests in suppressing onward transmission of COVID-19 in the contexts of quarantine and serial testing. Examining 18 RA tests that have received EUA from the U.S.A. FDA, we showed that conducting RA tests on entry and exit can provide a greater reduction in post-quarantine transmission than conducting a single RT-PCR test 24 h prior to quarantine exit. RT-PCR results can be delayed by one or more days

                             . In that case, RA tests outperform RT-PCR at reducing onward transmission via serial testing and case isolation due to their faster turnaround time. Accordingly, the frequency of serial RT-PCR testing required to suppress outbreaks increases substantially with the associated waiting times in obtaining results. While RA tests can reduce R

With the use of RA and RT-PCR testing data from a remote industrial setting, we validated our estimates of the PPA with RT-PCR of the BD Veritor RA test during a 5-day quarantine.

                             For quarantine policies with an exit test, RT-PCR tests typically must be conducted at least a day prior to the end of quarantine.

                             Supplementing an exit RA test with one upon entry to quarantine could allow RA tests to outperform a single RT-PCR test on exit for longer quarantine durations. Specifically, for more than 50% of RA tests considered, conducting a RA test on both entry and exit from quarantine produced a lower probability of post-quarantine transmission than an RT-PCR test on exit for quarantine durations up to 14 days. As prevalence in the community increases, having at least one false-negative in a cohort becomes more probable. Conducting a RA test on entry in addition to the one on exit mitigates the reduced sensitivity of a single test, thereby reducing the probability of releasing a still-infectious case from quarantine. Testing on alternative days to quarantine entry could increase the diagnostic sensitivity of the testing strategy even more than adding a test on entry. If logistically and financially feasible, diagnostic sensitivity can be increased further by testing on additional days. At a higher cost than a RA test, multiple RT-PCR tests could also be conducted in quarantine to increase the probability of identifying a case. Long quarantine durations have minimal practicality for entities trying to minimize interruptions to operations. By adding a less costly RA test on entry to the exit test, the quarantine duration could be reduced, substantially mitigating loss of productivity attributed to quarantine. Therefore, RA tests can be suitable alternatives to a single RT-PCR, especially for short quarantines of one or two days.

Several factors drive the consequences of surveillance frequency in terms of the number of false positives and extent of transmission, including (i) the sensitivity and specificity of the test, (ii) the number of people tested, (iii) the frequency of testing, and (iv) the background prevalence of the disease. For example, in a low-prevalence setting the probability of obtaining at least one false-positive in a cohort increases geometrically with the number of people tested and similarly with the frequency of testing per individual. Less frequent RA tests will reduce the chances of a false-positive during serial testing in a low-prevalence community, but at the cost of an outbreak occurring upon missing an infectious individual (R

Assiduous follow-up testing of identified potential cases that are isolated should be incorporated—especially remote offshore settings where false-positive cases may require extensive and costly measures such as evacuation. Given the higher specificity of RT-PCR, using an initial RA test with an RT-PCR follow-up for any positive can substantially reduce the number of RT-PCR tests, especially in a low-prevalence setting

A challenge to follow-up with RT-PCR testing is not just the increased logistical and economic costs: false-negatives can result in reintroduction into the surveilled population and onward transmission. Multiple follow-up tests are likely necessary to investigate conflicting test results. Accordingly, there are tradeoffs between the risks of transmission, number of tests conducted, processing times, and underlying costs from false positives regardless of the test utilized in surveillance. Therefore, policy decision-makers can adapt the testing schemes based on the current status of the epidemic to a level of risk that they find acceptable.

Considering community prevalence instead of transmission, investment in a testing strategy with greater specificity might be a more prudent approach in low-prevalence settings, whereas a testing strategy with high sensitivity becomes more important in communities with high prevalence. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of diagnostic sensitivity of tests that we have demonstrated is independent of the context-specific basic reproduction number.

For example, tests such as BinaxNOW, LumiraDx, and Simoa provided PPA data extending to at least 11 days post symptom onset. Other tests, such as Clip COVID, SCoV-2 Ag Detect, and Sofia 2 Flu + SARS provided results only extending five days beyond symptom onset (

For example, the single data point at the last observed time for the Ellume RA test was the only one that did not agree with RT-PCR. This thresholded disagreement yielded a rapid decline in the logistic regression model for the PPA. Establishing a minimum sample size that is sufficient to provide statistical power for inference of sensitivity across time-points spanning the disease course would improve sensitivity measurements and facilitate refinement in testing frequencies and necessary quarantines to suppress transmission.

Inaccurate characterization of early-phase diagnostic sensitivity would affect the results for entry testing, quarantines shorter than the incubation period, and the effectiveness of frequent serial testing. However, we were able to address the absence of PPA data in the incubation period by constructing a mapping between the infectivity and the PPA.

The infectivity profile of Omicron has not yet been determined. Preliminary evidence indicates that the viral load peaks between three to six days after diagnosis or symptom onset when infected with the Omicron variant.

                             This later peak in viral load relative to prior variants could indicate a shift toward a greater proportion of transmission occurring after symptom onset. Under these conditions, we would hypothesize that RA tests will be less effective at identifying cases during a 5-day quarantine compared to RT-PCR. Diagnostic sensitivity of the RA tests has remained fairly stable as SARS-CoV-2 has evolved

In two of the three comparisons (Sofia and CareStart), diagnostic sensitivity in independent analyses was lower than ideal conditions. The estimated quarantine duration and testing frequency were equivalent or more stringent under the internal dataset compared to the external dataset for two of the three tests (BinaxNOW and CareStart). Compared with outcomes for BD Veritor in quarantine and serial testing, we found that the estimates from our model were consistent with testing conducted among employees by medical personnel. These findings provide reassurance that internal datasets do not deviate substantially from the real-world utility and effectiveness of RA tests for disease control.

Our field test data demonstrated that serial offshore RA testing can be deployed with prescreening and a 24-h onshore quarantine with an RT-PCR test on entry while still maintaining an acceptable level of risk. The prevalence of disease that is potentially departing to offshore platforms is reduced by prescreening individuals entering quarantine. The extent of prospective secondary infections is diminished further with the combined 24-h quarantine and RT-PCR testing. With RA testing being more effective for short quarantines, they could also be a suitable alternative for the entry test and fly protocol. Our analysis for the BD Veritor RA tests highlights that testing every two days is sufficient to maintain R

The testing frequency was every three days on the offshore platform, although only conducted for part of the worker’s time offshore. Upon identification of an RT-PCR confirmed positive test, contact tracing mitigated additional transmission chains. Therefore, the data from this remote, densely populated setting illustrates the effective integration of RA tests into the layered control measure approach for mitigating disease outbreaks.

                             Our analyses of 18 COVID-19 RA tests currently approved for use in the U.S.A. provide a comprehensive comparative assessment with reference to the gold-standard RT-PCR. Our results highlight the scenarios in which RA tests would serve as a suitable and even beneficial alternative to RT-PCR tests, incorporating the temporal dynamics that crucially describe their sensitivity and specificity, and characterize the operationally important outcomes: for quarantine, post-quarantine transmission, surveillance and isolation, and for suppression of the reproduction number. New tests should similarly be evaluated by these key measurable outcomes, so that their utility can be compared for strategy implementation. Such analyses provide important insights into the possible trade-offs in decision-making processes on the type of tests to use for both congregate and community settings.
