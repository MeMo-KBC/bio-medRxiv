  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Portable breath ketone sensors may help people with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) avoid episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis; however the design features preferred by users have not been studied. We aimed to elucidate breath analysis and design preferences associated with commercial breath ketone devices among young people with T1DM aged 12-16 years and their parents in order to inform the development of a breath ketone sensor prototype for diabetes management.

Research Designs and Methods Two commercially available breath ketone sensors, designed for ketogenic diet monitoring, were explored over one week by ten young people with T1DM to get an insight into breath measurements. Participants interacted with the devices at least twice daily for five days, taking breath ketone, blood ketone and blood glucose measurements. Semi-structured interviews were conducted post-testing with the young participants and their caregivers to elicit preferences related to breath analysis and to inform the co-design of a diabetes breath ketone sensor prototype. To validate the results from a professional healthcare perspective, we interviewed two diabetes educators working in pediatric care about their perspective of young people using breath ketone sensors.

Results Participants acknowledged the non-invasiveness of breath sensors as compared to blood testing. Affordability, reliability and accuracy were identified as prerequisites for breath ketone sensors used for diabetes management. Design features valued by young people included portability, ease of use, sustainability, readability and suitability for use in public. The time required to use breath sensors was similar to that for blood testing. The requirement to maintain a 10-second breath exhalation posed a challenge for users. Diabetes educators highlighted the ease of use of breath devices especially for young people with insufficient blood ketone testing.

Conclusions Breath ketone sensors for diabetes management bear potential to facilitate ketone testing in young people. Our study affirms features for young people that drive usability of breath sensors among this population, and provides a model of user preference assessment.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background Portable breath ketone sensors may help people with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) avoid episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis; however the design features preferred by users have not been studied. We aimed to elucidate breath analysis and design preferences associated with commercial breath ketone devices among young people with T1DM aged 12-16 years and their parents in order to inform the development of a breath ketone sensor prototype for diabetes management.

Research Designs and Methods Two commercially available breath ketone sensors, designed for ketogenic diet monitoring, were explored over one week by ten young people with T1DM to get an insight into breath measurements. Participants interacted with the devices at least twice daily for five days, taking breath ketone, blood ketone and blood glucose measurements. Semi-structured interviews were conducted post-testing with the young participants and their caregivers to elicit preferences related to breath analysis and to inform the co-design of a diabetes breath ketone sensor prototype. To validate the results from a professional healthcare perspective, we interviewed two diabetes educators working in pediatric care about their perspective of young people using breath ketone sensors.

Results Participants acknowledged the non-invasiveness of breath sensors as compared to blood testing. Affordability, reliability and accuracy were identified as prerequisites for breath ketone sensors used for diabetes management. Design features valued by young people included portability, ease of use, sustainability, readability and suitability for use in public. The time required to use breath sensors was similar to that for blood testing. The requirement to maintain a 10-second breath exhalation posed a challenge for users. Diabetes educators highlighted the ease of use of breath devices especially for young people with insufficient blood ketone testing.

Conclusions Breath ketone sensors for diabetes management bear potential to facilitate ketone testing in young people. Our study affirms features for young people that drive usability of breath sensors among this population, and provides a model of user preference assessment.

                              Portable breath ketone sensors may help people with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) avoid episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis; however the design features preferred by users have not been studied. We aimed to elucidate breath analysis and design preferences associated with commercial breath ketone devices among young people with T1DM aged 12-16 years and their parents in order to inform the development of a breath ketone sensor prototype for diabetes management.

                              Two commercially available breath ketone sensors, designed for ketogenic diet monitoring, were explored over one week by ten young people with T1DM to get an insight into breath measurements. Participants interacted with the devices at least twice daily for five days, taking breath ketone, blood ketone and blood glucose measurements. Semi-structured interviews were conducted post-testing with the young participants and their caregivers to elicit preferences related to breath analysis and to inform the co-design of a diabetes breath ketone sensor prototype. To validate the results from a professional healthcare perspective, we interviewed two diabetes educators working in pediatric care about their perspective of young people using breath ketone sensors.

                              Participants acknowledged the non-invasiveness of breath sensors as compared to blood testing. Affordability, reliability and accuracy were identified as prerequisites for breath ketone sensors used for diabetes management. Design features valued by young people included portability, ease of use, sustainability, readability and suitability for use in public. The time required to use breath sensors was similar to that for blood testing. The requirement to maintain a 10-second breath exhalation posed a challenge for users. Diabetes educators highlighted the ease of use of breath devices especially for young people with insufficient blood ketone testing.

                              Breath ketone sensors for diabetes management bear potential to facilitate ketone testing in young people. Our study affirms features for young people that drive usability of breath sensors among this population, and provides a model of user preference assessment.

Based on their feedback, KetoPro and House of Keto Monitor sensors were assessed to be most suitable for further testing with study participants. Keyto and Ketonix devices were excluded because Keyto required an app to operate the device, increasing complexity for use.

During the five-day testing period, participants interacted with the devices at least twice daily. Breath ketone, blood ketone and blood glucose measures were taken in parallel before breakfast and after school but before eating, as ketone readings were expected to be higher after a period of fasting. We did not aim to conclude about the commercial devices’ (in)accuracy with breath and blood measurements taken throughout the testing period. Because testing did not happen in a clinical setting (testing for DKA) and because our participants were mostly not sick (no risk of DKA), and were not on a ketogenic diet, low (or even no) ketone readings were to be expected. The purpose of the breath-blood testing was not to evaluate device accuracy, but to trigger feedback about breath device usage in contrast to blood testing. Following the user-device interaction, online video- or telephone-interviews were conducted with participants accompanied by their parent(s) to elucidate their breath device preferences based on the experiences with the use of the commercial breath ketone devices. The use of the commercial devices gave the young people a sense about what a breath sensor device can deliver and how it works. In this way, the use of the commercial devices triggered feedback which was valuable for informing the development of a breath device specifically designed for diabetes management.

The professional perspective on young people using breath ketone sensors helped to comprehend young people’s feedback in more detail, and added important details and background information on breath sensor testing in youth.

                              Diabetes educators confirmed the usefulness of the sensors, especially as blood ketone testing by their patients was being followed less than was recommended, impacted by the price and availability of ketone strips. Breath ketone sensors were expected to be “very valuable” (#A) for insulin pump users as pump users “can develop ketones far more quickly” (#A) compared to individuals on multiple daily injection regimens with “long-acting insulin sitting in the background” (#A). One general challenge mentioned by the nurse educators (participants #A and B) related to people with T1DM who choose to follow a ketogenic diet. Such a diet generally was reported to impact ketone readings and was perceived as unsafe for youth with T1DM, thus this group required particular attention (#A).

                              Despite participants expectation of low ketone readings (#4, 7), accuracy remained a concern, and was reported to be the major obstacle to breath sensor use (#7). Breath readings frequently displayed no results as shown in

One young person wondered if toothpaste or other substances that included alcohol such as mouth wash might affect readings (#1). Another participant questioned whether the way of breathing into the device, such as interrupted breathing, affected device readings (#9). Breath sensor accuracy concerns (#7, 10) led some participants to favour blood tests over breath tests, and two said they would either prefer blood tests (#2), or wanted to avoid additional devices as the blood meter measured both ketone and glucose levels (#10). Accuracy was confirmed to be one of the most crucial preconditions for the breath sensors by the diabetes educators (#A and B).

                              Device set-up was considered to be easy and fast to complete (#1). Instructions to use the breath ketone sensors were described as “quite basic” (#2), and only available in English language (#1). The instructions did not deliver information about how to buy extra mouthpieces (#6) or how often to change mouthpieces for the House of Keto Monitor (#6, 9), while the KetoPro recommended mouthpieces be changed after 10-15 uses to avoid incorrect readings (#1). Some participants washed or sanitized mouthpieces for reuse (#1, 5, 7, 9, 10), two people used only one mouthpiece throughout (#3, 8), while one felt uncomfortable reusing them (#2). KetoPro provided six initial mouthpieces, while House of Keto Monitor provided four, which was felt to be too few by one participant (#9). Mouthpieces kept falling off in one case (#8). Overall, clear information was missing about how to use mouthpieces (#5, 6), or how to breathe into the devices (#9).

Trademarks or TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) approval were perceived as important for diabetes breath sensors (#6).

In general, it was estimated that a breath test took approximately the same time as a blood test (#7, 9). Device warm-up time was reported to be 10-20 seconds, with 20 seconds being perceived as too long by one participant (#3). More concerning was that the devices required a breath of 10 seconds to achieve a test result, which was challenging for six participants (#2-4, 8-10). One participant suggested that the user should not have to actively breathe into the breath sensor but just count out loud close to the device similar to advanced alcohol testing devices (#9).

The breath sensors could fit into the diabetes pencil case carrier (#9) due to their “compact” (#1, 4, 5) design. Half of the participants suggested “a little bit smaller” device size (#10, similar 1, 3, 6, 8); yet three participants pointed out that it might be difficult to hold the device if it was too small (#1, 2), especially if one had “big hands” (#7). Breath sensor shapes were perceived as comfortable (#3), like “a good handle” shape (#1) with finger grips (House of Keto Monitor) being perceived as convenient (#6, 7).

One mother said that simplicity was not an issue with most young people being “tech savvy” (#7). The fact that the breath sensor user could not see the screen while breathing, and thus did not know when to stop was considered problematic (#5).

                              Advantages of the breath sensor over the blood meter were its non-invasiveness, avoiding the pain and messiness of finger-pricking (#1-7, 10). This was seen as especially beneficial for younger children (#7, 9). Moreover, participants mentioned the convenience of the breath sensor (#1, 3-10), the clean procedure (#5, 7, 8), the compact design without additional required parts (#1, 5, 9), and the suitability for use in remote areas (#10) or when traveling when finger pricking is difficult due to hygiene requirements (#9). Participants also highlighted the improved convenience at school with easy, quick and discreet use of the breath sensor (#4-6).

                              Sustainability of the breath sensors was considered an advantage, with less waste produced such as used test strips (#1, 3, 7). Breath sensor maintenance was perceived as more convenient than blood device maintenance (#6), due to not having to have a personal stash of spare test strips (#4), given the haphazard commercial availability of ketone strips (#4, 10). Ketone strips were costly (#4, 8), and expired after a certain time if unused (#6).

In addition, “ongoing cost” (#B) could be reduced with a compact breath device without additional required parts (#B).

All our participants were 16 years and younger. The initial stage of sensor selection for usability assessment was performed by other young people with TIDM who are fellow researchers in our consumer-focused research program. The 10 young people who tested the devices were familiar with personalized measuring devices, and highly familiar with technological solutions. The existence of a “like” device (non-medical breath ketone devices) provided an opportunity to road test features which are valuable for a diabetes-specific breath sensor for young people with T1DM, and to engage with their own views to emphasize valued elements. It is worth noting that the more tech-enhanced devices (those requiring an app, or converting data into visual codes or trends) were relatively undervalued attributes by young users. They placed more emphasis on functionality (portability, ease of use and readability) and noted that aesthetics (having a customizable appearance) and being unobtrusive were also important. The latter should not be surprising for young people with a condition which declares itself every time they have to give themselves an insulin injection in public.

                             Breath ketone sensors for diabetes management bear potential to facilitate and improve ketone testing in young people. Our study affirms the key features for young people that drive usability of a breath ketone sensor among this population, and provides a model of user preference assessment among young users. The user experiences with available commercial breath sensors for a ketogenic diet can inform and improve the development of co-designed diabetes-specific breath ketone sensors.
