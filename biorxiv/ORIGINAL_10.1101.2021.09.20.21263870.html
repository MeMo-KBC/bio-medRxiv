Intranasal administration of OXT is widely used to examine its functional effects in both adults and children and is assumed to enter the brain directly via this route. However, OXT can also influence brain function via increased blood concentrations and we have recently shown that orally (lingual) administered OXT also modulates neural responses to emotional faces and may be better tolerated for therapeutic use. Here, we examined if 24IU OXT administered orally can facilitate social attention. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, pharmacological study we used a validated emotional anti-saccade eye-tracking paradigm to explore effects of oral OXT on bottom-up and top-down attention processing in 80 healthy male subjects. Our findings showed in terms of top-down attention, oral OXT increased errors for both social (angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral emotion faces) and non-social stimuli (oval shapes) in the anti-saccade condition but only increased response latencies in the social condition. It also significantly reduced post-task state anxiety but this was not correlated with task performance. Comparison with our previous intranasal OXT study using the same task revealed both routes have a similar effect on increasing anti-saccade errors and response latencies and reducing state anxiety. Overall, findings suggest that oral administration of OXT produces similar effects on top-down social attention control and anxiety as intranasal administration and may therefore have therapeutic utility.

  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) modulates social cognition by increasing attention towards social cues and may have therapeutic potential for impaired social attention in disorders such as autism. Intranasal administration of OXT is widely used to examine its functional effects in both adults and children and is assumed to enter the brain directly via this route. However, OXT can also influence brain function via increased blood concentrations and we have recently shown that orally (lingual) administered OXT also modulates neural responses to emotional faces and may be better tolerated for therapeutic use. Here, we examined if 24IU OXT administered orally can facilitate social attention. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, pharmacological study we used a validated emotional anti-saccade eye-tracking paradigm to explore effects of oral OXT on bottom-up and top-down attention processing in 80 healthy male subjects. Our findings showed in terms of top-down attention, oral OXT increased errors for both social (angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral emotion faces) and non-social stimuli (oval shapes) in the anti-saccade condition but only increased response latencies in the social condition. It also significantly reduced post-task state anxiety but this was not correlated with task performance. Comparison with our previous intranasal OXT study using the same task revealed both routes have a similar effect on increasing anti-saccade errors and response latencies and reducing state anxiety. Overall, findings suggest that oral administration of OXT produces similar effects on top-down social attention control and anxiety as intranasal administration and may therefore have therapeutic utility.

                             The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) modulates social cognition by increasing attention towards social cues and may have therapeutic potential for impaired social attention in disorders such as autism. Intranasal administration of OXT is widely used to examine its functional effects in both adults and children and is assumed to enter the brain directly via this route. However, OXT can also influence brain function via increased blood concentrations and we have recently shown that orally (lingual) administered OXT also modulates neural responses to emotional faces and may be better tolerated for therapeutic use. Here, we examined if 24IU OXT administered orally can facilitate social attention. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, pharmacological study we used a validated emotional anti-saccade eye-tracking paradigm to explore effects of oral OXT on bottom-up and top-down attention processing in 80 healthy male subjects. Our findings showed in terms of top-down attention, oral OXT increased errors for both social (angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral emotion faces) and non-social stimuli (oval shapes) in the anti-saccade condition but only increased response latencies in the social condition. It also significantly reduced post-task state anxiety but this was not correlated with task performance. Comparison with our previous intranasal OXT study using the same task revealed both routes have a similar effect on increasing anti-saccade errors and response latencies and reducing state anxiety. Overall, findings suggest that oral administration of OXT produces similar effects on top-down social attention control and anxiety as intranasal administration and may therefore have therapeutic utility.

                             Studies investigating the functional effects of acute or chronic OXT treatment in both clinical and preclinical contexts have mainly used an intranasal administration route, largely guided by evidence that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is relatively impermeable to OXT and that intranasally administered OXT can directly enter into the brain via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves (

                             Recently we investigated if an oral (lingual) route of OXT administration in humans can produce functional effects. This can only increase OXT concentrations in the blood and gastrointestinal system without any possibility of direct entry into the brain (

Importantly, from a potential therapeutic standpoint in children with autism, an oral route of chronic administration should be better tolerated than either nasal sprays or intravenous infusions. The initial results obtained have been encouraging, demonstrating that oral OXT more potently enhanced responses in the brain reward system and amygdala to emotional faces compared to intranasal application (

                             Against this background, the present study aimed to explore the effect of oral OXT on social attention including both top-down and bottom-up attention control to social cues using the same validated emotional anti-saccade task we have previously employed to examine the effects of intranasal OXT (

                             ). The emotional anti-saccade task includes emotional faces (angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral) as social stimuli and oval shapes as non-social stimuli. Participants are either instructed to look towards the stimuli (pro-saccade) or away from them (anti-saccade) in this task. During the pro-saccade condition participants focus on the target automatically which involves “bottom-up” attention processing while during the anti-saccade condition they need to inhibit reflexive orienting towards stimuli by implementing voluntary “top-down” attention control (

                             ). In our previous study we found that intranasal OXT selectively reduced subjects’ ability to engage top-down attention control to look away from socially salient stimuli and therefore increased anti-saccade errors (

                             ). We also found that intranasal OXT decreased post-task state anxiety in line with previous studies showing its anxiolytic effects (

                             Some previous studies have demonstrated effects of state anxiety on attention control with respect to both anti-saccade and pro-saccade conditions in this task (

                             ). Accumulating evidence indicates that anxiety may contribute to slower anti-saccade latencies (considered to reflect performance efficiency) but not on errors (considered as performance effectiveness)(see

                             ). These findings suggest a specific modulatory role of state anxiety in performance efficiency rather than effectiveness in terms of top-down attention control. However, associations between the effects of OXT on anxiety and on attention processing in this task have not been examined. We therefore additionally investigated if any effects of oral OXT administration on attention control were influenced by state anxiety.

                             In order to compare the effects of orally and intranasally administered OXT findings from the current oral dose study were further compared with those from our previous intranasal study where subjects received the same OXT dose (

                             ). Given increasing evidence for functional effects of exogenous OXT following peripheral changes in concentrations we hypothesized that orally administered OXT would produce similar effects on top-down attentional control as we have previously observed following intranasal administration, particularly with social stimuli. We additionally hypothesized that oral OXT would produce similar decreases in state anxiety. Given previous findings that anxiety does not influence anti-saccade errors we additionally hypothesized no association between the effects of oral OXT on attention and state anxiety in the context of this task.

Firstly, to determine the effects of oral OXT on attention control for social stimuli, treatment (OXT/PLC) * condition (social/non-social) * task (pro-/anti-saccade) mixed ANOVAs were conducted on both error rates and latencies. Then, to explore stimulus-specific effects of oral OXT on attention processing, we further conducted treatment * task * stimuli (angry/sad/fearful/happy/neutral/shapes) mixed ANOVAs on error rates and latencies.

                             Overall the current pharmacological study using an emotional anti-saccade eye tracking paradigm revealed that orally administered OXT increased anti-saccade error rates for both social and non-social stimuli but only increased response latencies for all social stimuli, suggesting oral OXT may particularly reduce performance efficiency with respect to top-down social attention control. Oral OXT also reduced state anxiety scores indicating an anxiolytic effect, although there was no association between state anxiety scores and task performance. An additional comparison for the effects of oral compared to intranasal OXT administration revealed no significant differences between routes of administration either on the anti-saccade task errors and response latencies or on anxiolytic effects. Together these findings suggest that oral OXT may produce a similar therapeutic utility as intranasal route on disorders especially with social attention deficits.

                             In the current study our main finding was that orally administered OXT increased errors for both social (angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral emotion faces) and non-social stimuli (oval shapes) in the anti-saccade task but only increased saccade response latencies for social emotional faces. This suggests that oral OXT treatment is having a general effect on top-down attention control in terms of performance effectiveness (errors) but a more selective effect on performance efficiency (saccade response latencies) for social stimuli. Based on the framework of attention control theory (

                             ), the results indicate that following oral OXT relative to PLC treatment subjects need to dedicate more effort and attentional resource to shift attention away from stimuli, particularly social ones.

                             Our other main finding in the present study was that orally administered OXT produced similar effects to intranasal OXT on top-down social attention in terms of both increased anti-saccade errors and longer saccade response times during presentation of stimuli. We used Bayes to test the robustness of the non-significant difference between the routes of administration and a Bayes factor >3 was found for analysis of anti-saccade errors, indicating moderate evidence for the null model of the non-significant difference (
                             <a id="xref-ref-21-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21">

                             ). While the previous intranasal OXT study did report some evidence for a social-specific effect of treatment it was only marginal and this may explain the lack of evidence for a statistical difference between the effects of oral and intranasal routes. For the response latency analysis on the other hand we only found anecdotal evidence to support the null-hypothesis suggesting there may be some differential effect of the two routes of administration. Indeed, only oral OXT significantly increasing response times for the social stimuli.

                             Oral similar to intranasal OXT administration also reduced post-task state anxiety scores, indicating an anxiolytic effect. Again the magnitude of effects produced by the two routes of administration were similar and the Bayes analysis revealed a moderate Bayes factor of >3 supporting the null-hypothesis. These findings are in line with a number of previous studies reporting anxiolytic effects of intranasal OXT. However, we found no evidence to support a significant association between performance on the attention task used and state anxiety under either OXT or PLC treatment, and thus it seems unlikely that in the context of this specific paradigm effects of OXT on top-down attention were influenced by its anxiolytic effects. While some previous studies have shown that increased rather than decreased anxiety can decrease top-down attention (

                             ). Unlike the majority of above studies reporting effects of anxiety on top-down attention we did not only include subjects with high trait anxiety and this may have resulted in a lack of association between state anxiety and attention performance. Also, reduced state anxiety scores under OXT treatment may not have been sufficiently great to significantly influence performance.

                             In terms of the ongoing debate concerning how intranasally administered OXT may act to modulate neural and behavioral functions, our findings provide further support for the importance of increased OXT concentrations in the peripheral vascular system and/or gastrointestinal system producing neural changes either via RAGE-mediated transport across the BBB or via vagal stimulation. While this does not rule out additional contributions of direct entry of OXT into the brain via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves following intranasal administration, it provides increased support for this not being the only route. Interestingly however, the current findings, together with those of our previous study (

                             ) raising the possibility that route-dependent functional effects may be influenced by the dose. Thus, at this stage it is possible there may be interactions between OXT dose (both concentration and frequency) and route of administration which determine functional effects.

                             The effects of oral administration of OXT on top-down social attention processing are similar to those we have previously reported after intranasal administration of vasopressin (Z

                             ). This suggests that both peptides have facilitatory effects on social attention and that both may act to enhance the salience of social stimuli as has been proposed for OXT (

                             ). There is the possibility of cross-talk between receptors since both peptides can stimulate each other’s receptors to some extent (

                             ). However, with at least a 10-fold reduction in affinity for the other peptide’s receptors it seems more likely that both produce enhanced social attention via acting on their own receptors.

                             There are several limitations which should be acknowledged in the current study. First, only male subjects were included in the present study to be in line with the intranasal OXT study (

                             ) and given a translational focus on autism. Some previous studies in rodents have reported sex-specific behavioral and neural effects of peripherally administered OXT (

                             ), although not for social attention paradigms. However, future studies will be needed to explore oral OXT’s effect on attention control in both male and female subjects. Second, in line with previous studies, oval shapes served as non-social stimuli but are less complex than emotional faces. Future studies could consider using objects or natural scenes as non-social control stimuli to match the complexity of faces. Third, given that the PANAS and SAI questionnaires were only measured prior to oral treatment and post-task, it cannot be determined whether the observed anxiolytic effect in oral OXT group was due to OXT treatment per se or a combination of treatment and task. Fourth, it should be noted that although the total sample size (n = 151, intranasal study: n = 71, oral study: n = 80) is sufficient to achieve 80% power for a medium effect size (f = 0.25) in the comparison study, treatment groups are only randomly assigned within the two independent experiments and not across them.

                             In summary, the current study using a validated emotional anti-saccade paradigm which can measure treatment effects on both top-down and bottom-up attentional processing revealed that in terms of top-down attention control oral OXT decreased performance effectiveness across all stimuli but selectively modulated performance efficiency for social stimuli. Comparison of the effects of oral OXT with those we have previously reported for intranasal OXT revealed that OXT via both routes produced similar effects on top-down attention and state anxiety. Overall, these findings suggest that some key functional effects of exogenous OXT administration involve an influence on the brain via the peptide being transported from the blood across the BBB and/or via vagally mediated effects. The findings also suggest that OXT administered via an oral route may be useful in a therapeutic context, particularly for children where intranasal administration may be less well tolerated.
