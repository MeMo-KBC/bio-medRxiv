  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is growing human and animal health concern around the world. When a number of studies have emphasized the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) regarding antibiotic use and resistance in humans, little attention has been paid to the veterinary sector. The aim of this study was to understand the KAP towards antibiotic use and resistance among the veterinarians in Bangladesh.

Methods A cross-sectional online based questionnaire survey was conducted from August to September 2020 among the registered veterinary practitioners. A self-administered Google form questionnaire consists of 45 questions on knowledge, attitude and practice regarding antibiotic use and resistance were used.

Results A total of 208 registered veterinarians participated in this study. 85.1% of the participants were male and 54.8% of the participants had a Masters degree. Around 52% of the veterinarians were poultry practitioners. All respondents were familiar with antimicrobials. The participants (91.4%) knew that antibiotics can not cure viral infections while 97.6% believed that frequent antibiotic prescription rendered them less effective. Participants claimed that only they are eligible to prescribe drugs for the treatment of animals and around 80% disagreed with adding antibiotics with feed/water as a growth promoter in livestock. Of the total participants, 87% believed that a local antimicrobial guideline would be more effective than an international one. However, gaps in practices were highlighted in our study, suggesting training deficiencies.

Conclusion The present study for the first time conducted in Bangladesh dictates the future interventions like academic courses, workshops, and seminars on antibiotic usage and resistance are needed to ameliorate the knowledge, behavior and practice of veterinarians with regards to the rational use of antibiotics.

                              The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is growing human and animal health concern around the world. When a number of studies have emphasized the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) regarding antibiotic use and resistance in humans, little attention has been paid to the veterinary sector. The aim of this study was to understand the KAP towards antibiotic use and resistance among the veterinarians in Bangladesh.

                              A total of 208 registered veterinarians participated in this study. 85.1% of the participants were male and 54.8% of the participants had a Masters degree. Around 52% of the veterinarians were poultry practitioners. All respondents were familiar with antimicrobials. The participants (91.4%) knew that antibiotics can not cure viral infections while 97.6% believed that frequent antibiotic prescription rendered them less effective. Participants claimed that only they are eligible to prescribe drugs for the treatment of animals and around 80% disagreed with adding antibiotics with feed/water as a growth promoter in livestock. Of the total participants, 87% believed that a local antimicrobial guideline would be more effective than an international one. However, gaps in practices were highlighted in our study, suggesting training deficiencies.

Antibiotics in the Watch group have a greater resistance potential and comprise the majority of the top priority agents among the critically important antimicrobials for human medicine and/or antibiotics that are at reasonably high risk of bacterial resistance selection. Reserve group antibiotics should be reserved for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms, whether confirmed or suspected. Antibiotics in the reserve category should be used only as a ‘last resort’. Antibiotics in the access group are active against a broad variety of regularly encountered susceptible infections while also having a lesser resistance potential than antibiotics in the other categories. The findings of other studies identified that registered veterinarians also prescribed higher classes of antibiotics widely for treating healthy and unhealthy poultry flocks [

                              A cross-sectional study was conducted from August to September, 2020 using a self administered questionnaire. Using a purposive sampling, data collection was conducted among the registered veterinary practitioners of Bangladesh listed by the Bangladesh Veterinary Council (BVC)-government regulatory body of veterinary legislation and certification for veterinary practices in Bangladesh. To date, there are 7536 registered veterinarian in Bangladesh. BVC listed veterinarians are only certified person to treat and prescribe the antibiotics for the animals. Through social media(Facebook, LinkedIn and WhatsApp), the questionnaire was posted and circulated in different veterinary professional groups. The social media based survey was launched on August 05, 2020. In mid-September, 2020, the online questionnaire link of questionnaire was also messaged via mobile and facebook messanger text and emailed to each registered veterinarian to boost the response rate. Regarding the sample size, the aim was to include as many veterinarians as possible.

                              An online based approximate 20-30 minutes long questionnaire was developed using the Google Forms platform by a multidisciplinary team consisting of microbiologist, public health specialist and epidemiologist. The questionnaire comprised of four sections: the first one consisted of the demographic information of the veterinarians, second section included 13 questions on knowledge on antibiotics and AMR, third section contained 14 questions on attitudes and fourth section had 18 questions on practices regarding antibiotic use and their resistance. The majority of the answers were in multiple choice format. The questionnaire was pretested among the veterinarians at the Antimicrobial Resistance Action Center (ARAC), Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI) to validate and finalize the questionnaire. Finally, minor changes has been made in compliance with participants response and was circulated to the registered veterinarians. All the participants from ARAC in the pilot study were reminded to not participate in the final survey. Respondents were asked to read the consent paper and made aware of the purpose of the study and requested to provide consent before participating in the survey. The participation in the survey was completely non-compulsory and unpaid. If participants were willing to participate in the survey, they were first asked to click the “Yes” button as a consent before continuing to the next sections. To prevent the loss of confidentiality, no identifying information of the participant was collected. In addition, all data were exported into an excel file and given a serial number. This data was only accessible to the research team and investigators.

Practitioners also had a positive attitude towards vaccination for the purpose of preventing diseases and for reducing the use of antibiotics in animals. Most practitioners (99%) felt that national guideline on rational antibiotic use is necessary and 87% believed a local antimicrobial guideline would be more useful than an international one. Around 80% disagreed with adding antibiotics with feed/water as a growth promoter in poultry and livestock. Regarding the major reasons of antibiotic resistance, irrational use of antibiotics was identified as the primary cause by 94.71%, followed by over-the-counter use, low dose, low-quality antibiotics, and waste disposal of antibiotics (

                              The majority (70.2%) of the veterinarians reported that they sometimes prescribe antibiotics over the phone or without examining the animals. Also, only 9.1% of the practitioners always or often recommend antimicrobial susceptibility testing before prescribing an antibiotic agents. Half of the participants prefer broad-spectrum antibiotics while the other half prefer narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Results also showed that antibiotics constitute a large percentage of daily prescribed drugs. Moreover, combined antibiotic therapy is also preferred to single therapy by about 65% of the practitioners, and old generation antibiotics are preferred to new generation antibiotics by most (63.5%) as a first-line treatment. Some practitioners (26%) reported prescribing antibiotics without determining the bodyweight of the animals. Most practitioners (74.5) do not mention the antibiotic withdrawal period in the prescriptions. When exploring the factors considered by the vets while prescribing antibiotics, the severity of the disease was found to be the most important factor. The vets also considered other factors such as availability of an antibiotic in the local market, culture sensitivity test report, economic status of the owner, and owners’ demand for antibiotics (

                             The present study explored the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the Bangladeshi veterinary practitioners regarding antibiotic use and resistance. It was found that some vets had gaps in knowledge in certain crucial concepts, for example, many practitioners (17.3%) considered antibiotics and antimicrobials to be the same. Failure to differentiate between antimicrobials and antibiotics and their roles can be a major reason for inappropriate antibiotic prescribing such as prescribing antibiotics for viral infections. Another surprising finding was that although most knew that antibiotics cannot cure viral infections, one-third of the vets believed antibiotics would speed up cold, cough, or other viral infections. However, there is no evidence that antibiotics can cure viral infections or speed up recovery of viral infections such as common cold [

                             Nearly all veterinarians were aware of antibiotic withdrawal period and considered it important to maintain an appropriate withdrawal period prior to selling animals treated with antibiotics in order to avoid antibiotic residues in animals. However paradoxically, while prescribing antibiotics, only one out of four practitioners mentioned the withdrawal period in the prescriptions. This may happen probably because practitioners do not have the knowledge of the withdrawal periods of the specific antibiotics they prescribe, or because they think the farmers will not understand or follow instructions related to withdrawal periods anyway. Besides, previous studies have shown that most Bangladeshi farmers do not have knowledge on antibiotic withdrawal period [

                             Prescribing antibiotics based on the results of susceptibility testing is recommended to make sure that the prescribed regimen is effective against the infection. However, in this study, such practice was not often followed by the practitioners even after the initial treatment failed. This can partially be explained by the fact that most areas of Bangladesh did not have any facility to test antimicrobial sensitivity, as reported by the veterinarians. The absence of susceptibility data can also promote combined antibiotic therapy since the vets may want to prescribe more than one drug for maximizing the chance of therapeutic success with the hope that if one drug is found ineffective, the others will work. A study of the veterinary surgeons of the United Kingdom also reported similar findings where the surgeons only occasionally carried out susceptibility testing [

We have identified a number of inappropriate practices by the veterinarians including excessive antibiotic prescribing, prescribing antibiotics over the phone without examining animals, not relying on susceptibility testing, not mentioning antibiotic withdrawal period in prescription, etc.

                             This survey revealed the varied difference in knowledge, attitude and practice of antibiotics use among different aged group of veterinarians in Bangladesh. It was not conclusively established the variation of predefined questions answer with the different aged group of vets. From this study it revealed that old aged vets with higher training or field based training have a higher knowledge of appropriate use of antibiotics and AMR. The difference has observed among vets aged groups that possibly could have the link to work experiences over time. To understand the perceptions and barriers, further investigation is required to appropriate use of antibiotics in livestock and in poultry among the vets subpopulation. It would help the policy makers and academicians to ensure proper training and impart practical field based knowledge of appropriate use of antibiotics and AMR to the vets students, young vets and all level aged groups of vets.

Veterinarians should also play an active role in dispelling misconceptions of the farmers surrounding antibiotics, and themselves should adopt the appropriate practices. The government should focus on implementing the laws pertaining to judicious use of antibiotics, as well as recruiting more qualified veterinarians so that farmers can have easy access to them.

                              A few limitations were witnessed during conduct the current study. The number of participants in the survey was low that may be due to several factors such as unwillingness to participate or lack of internet access or long questionnaire or some questions seemed too difficult. Sometimes respondents may have declined to share information they considered inappropriate or mistaken, resulting in an under-reporting of certain aspects on antibiotics and AMR knowledge and practices. The study could not meet the exact proportional number of respondents with anticipated geographic locations due to freedom of choice of the respondents.

                             The study findings suggest policy guidelines and advocacy to the public and private veterianrians in improving prudent use of antibiotics. Antimicrobial stewardship program in the public and private veterinary hospitals are needed to be initiated to promote the rational use of antibiotics. Improved knowledge and awareness of the veterinarians through continuous education and training can enhance the rational use of antibiotics. Dissemination of regularly updated national antibiotic use guidelines in food animals, understanding the role of good biosecurity and vaccination practices in disease prevention, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing at affordable costs with easy accessibility are the significant factors that need attention to combat the rising AMR in veterinary sector in Bangladesh.
