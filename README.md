# Logging in to the University server
 
To be able to share our code better we have a server from the university to work on.  
That server has the ip adress `139.6.160.19`.

To be able to reach the server you have to be in the [**VPN**](https://www.th-koeln.de/hochschule/vpn---virtual-private-network_26952.php) of the university.  

### Opening Labelstudio
1. Login to the VPN.  
2. When opening label-studio for the first time you have to register an account.
To do this open this link: http://139.6.160.19:8080/user/signup/?token=117a65a7bbb9144f and register with a email adress and password.
3. From now on you can login over: http://139.6.160.19:8080
