  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background In December 2019, a novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China. On 19 January and on 8 June 2020, there were two wave COVID-19 epidemics happened in Beijing. Modelling, simulations and analysis for the two wave epidemics are important issues.

Methods This study introduces a symptomatic-asymptomatic-recoverer-death differential equation model (SARDDE). It presents the conditions of the asymptotical stability on the disease-free equilibrium of the SARDDE. It proposes the necessary conditions of disease spreading for the SARDDE. Based on the reported data of the first and the second COVID-19 epidemics in Beijing and numerical simulations, it determines the parameters of the SARDDE, respectively.

Results Numerical simulations of the SARDDE describe well the outcomes of the current symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, the recovered symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and the died infected individuals, respectively. The numerical simulations obtain the following results.

Conclusions Virtual simulations suggest that the strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Beijing government are effective and necessary; using the data from the beginning to the days after about two weeks after the turning points can estimate well and approximately the following outcomes of the two COVID-19 epidemics, respectively. To avoid multiple epidemic outbreaks, a recommendation is that the authorities need to have maintained the prevention and control measures implemented, at least, 7 days after reaching the turning point until new current infection cases disappear. It is expected that the research can provide better understanding, explaining, and dominating for epidemic spreads, prevention and control measures.

  <meta name="citation_abstract" lang="en" content="<p>Background:  Globally COVID-19 epidemics have
caused tremendous disasters.China  prevented  effectively  the spread of COVID-19 epidemics
before 2022. Recently  Omicron and Delta variants cause a surge in reported  COVID-19 infections.

Methods: Using differential equations and real word data, this study modelings and simulates COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China
during December 31 2021 to December 6 2022, estimates the transmission rates, the recovery rates, and the blocking rates to the symptomatic and the asymptomatic infections. The transmission
rates and the recovery  rates of the foreign input COVID-19 infected individuals in mainland China have also been studied. Using virtual
simulations predict the outcomes of the epidemics.

Results:  The simulation results were  in good agreement with the real word data.
(1)   The average  input transmission rate of the foreign input symptomatic infection individuals
 was much lower than the average transmission
rates  of the symptomatic infection causing by the mainland symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.
(2)  The average  input transmission rate of the foreign input asymptomatic infection individuals 
was much lower than the average transmission
rate  of the asymptomatic infection causing by the mainland symptomatic individuals.
(3)  The average recovery rates  of the foreign input COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals were much higher than the average recovery rates  of the mainland COVID-19
 
For the mainland domestic epidemic simulations:
(1)  If kept the transmission rates, the recovery rates, the death rate and the blocking rates  on day 181 (June 30, 2022), the numbers of the current symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals would reduce to about one  on day 270 (September 27, 2022). 
(2)  If kept the transmission rates, the recovery rates, the death rate and the blocking rates   on day 340 (December 6, 2022) until day 377 (January 16, 2023), the numbers of the current symptomatic and the asymptomatic infected individuals would increase to 38896 and 230926,respectively,  the cumulative death individuals would  increase from 599 to   615, respectively.
(3)  If kept the transmission rates, the recovery rates on day 340, but decreased the blocking rates  to 30% and select the death rate
to equal to the average death rate during days 104-150, then the simulation showed that on day 377, the numbers of current symptomatic and the asymptomatic infected individuals would increase
to about 337236820 and 501624520, respectively,  and the cumulative death individuals would reach about 1 011 768.

For the foreign input epidemic simulations:
(1)   If kept the transmission rates, the recovery rates, and the blocking rates  on day 99  (April 9, 2022) until day 340,   the numbers of
the current symptomatic and the asymptomatic infected individuals would decrease to about 1 and 40, respectively on day  215 ((August 3), and  0  and 1  on day 340, respectively.
(2)  If kept the transmission rates, the recovery rates, the death rate and the blocking rates   on day 340 until day 377 (January 16,2023), the numbers of the current symptomatic and the asymptomatic infected individuals would decrease and increase  to 185 and 1935,respectively.

Recommendations  on  COVID-19 epidemic base on WHO9s technic guidelines and HBV Infection in
Chimpanzees are provided.


 Conclusions:
(1) For the mainland individuals9 epidemic, keeping  the blocking rates  of  over  86% and 93%  to the symptomatic and   asymptomatic infections , and the recovery rates  of   over 0.119 and 0.112 to the   symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals  may make the numbers of the current symptomatic and   asymptomatic   infected individuals to decrease to  very low levels in three months.
(2) For the foreign input  individuals9 epidemic, keeping  the transmission  rates of under  0.07  to the symptomatic and   asymptomatic infections , and the recovery rates  of   over 0.125 and 0.099 to the   symptomatic and   asymptomatic individuals  may make the numbers of the current symptomatic and   asymptomatic   infected individuals to decrease to  very low levels in four months.
(3)  Decreasing  the blocking rates of  under  30%  to the     symptomatic and   asymptomatic infections my cause  over 800 millions individuals9   COVID-19 infections   and over 10 millions  COVID-19 infected  individuals9 death.

(4) It is necessary that administrations implement strict prevent and control strategies to prevent the spread of new COVID-19 variants.</p>"/>

                              This study introduces a symptomatic-asymptomatic-recoverer-death differential equation model (SARDDE).

Based on the reported data of the first and the second COVID-19 epidemics in Beijing and numerical simulations, it determines the parameters of the SARDDE, respectively.

                              Virtual simulations suggest that the strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Beijing government are effective and necessary; using the data from the beginning to the days after about two weeks after the turning points can estimate well and approximately the following outcomes of the two COVID-19 epidemics, respectively. To avoid multiple epidemic outbreaks, a recommendation is that the authorities need to have maintained the prevention and control measures implemented, at least, 7 days after reaching the turning point until new current infection cases disappear. It is expected that the research can provide better understanding, explaining, and dominating for epidemic spreads, prevention and control measures.

                             One of the reasons of such a tragedy is that people in some countries do not pay attentions to theoretical analysis and estimations for COVID-19 epidemics. In fact mathematical models for epidemic infectious diseases have played important roles in the formulation, evaluation, and prevention of control strategies. Modelling the dynamics of spread of disease can help people to understand the mechanism of epidemic diseases, formulate and evaluate prevention and control strategies, and predict tools for the spread or disappearance of an epidemic [

Numerical simulations of the SARDDE describe well the practical outcomes of current infected symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, recovered infected symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and died infected individuals. Virtual simulations are given to estimate the effectiveness of the prevention and control strategies. This paper improves the simulation results implemented in the previous version of this paper [

                             Because not all infected people can go to the hospital for treatment and be confirmed at the first time. In some cases: adequate resources, no shortage of beds and medical treatment advantages, patients may be left behind when they are discharged from the hospital. Therefore, it does not have very important that the simulation results of the model are required accurately describe every datum reported on the epidemic. Long-term accumulated data, such as the total number of patients and the number of deaths may eliminate short-term deviations. Therefore, the accuracy of predicting long-term epidemics should be the standard for evaluating the rationality of the selected model and unknown model parameters.

                             When a society cannot withstand high transmission blocking rate load (for example 99%), how can administrative authorities take measures to avoid multiple outbreaks? A recommendation is that the authorities need to at least maintain the prevention and control measures implemented 7 days after reaching the turning point. Administrative authorities need to persuade their society to implement a prevention and control strategy to be withstood until all infection cases are cleared up. It is not a wise strategy to withdraw all prevention and control measures before the number of the all infected people have been cleared up. 100% blocking rate to transmission of COVID-19 infection is the keystone strategy to clear up or reduce spread of an epidemic as early as possible.

                             The strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Beijing government is not only effective but also necessary. It is expected that the research can provide better understanding, explanation, and dominating the spreads and control measures of epidemics.
