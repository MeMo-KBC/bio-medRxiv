  <meta name="DC.Description" content="In response to the demand for N95 respirators by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated decontamination of N95 respirators using an aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP) system. This system is designed to dispense a consistent atomized spray of aerosolized, 7% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution over a treatment cycle. Multiple N95 respirator models were subjected to ten or more cycles of respirator decontamination, with a select number periodically assessed for qualitative and quantitative fit testing. In parallel, we assessed the ability of aHP treatment to inactivate multiple viruses absorbed onto respirators, including phi6 bacteriophage, HSV-1, CVB3, and SARS-CoV-2. For pathogens transmitted via respiratory droplets and aerosols, it is critical to address respirator safety for reuse. This study provided experimental validation of an aHP treatment process that decontaminates the respirators while maintaining N95 function. External NIOSH certification verified respirator structural integrity and filtration efficiency after ten rounds of aHP treatment. Virus inactivation by aHP was comparable to the decontamination of commercial spore-based biological indicators. These data demonstrate that the aHP process is effective, with successful fit-testing of respirators after multiple aHP cycles, effective decontamination of multiple virus species including SARS-CoV- 2, successful decontamination of bacterial spores, and filtration efficiency maintained at or greater than 95%. While this study did not include extended or clinical use of N95 respirators between aHP cycles, these data provide proof of concept for aHP decontamination of N95 respirators before reuse in a crisis-capacity scenario.

Importance The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented pressure on healthcare and research facilities to provide personal protective equipment. The respiratory nature of the SARS-CoV2 pathogen makes respirator facepieces a critical protection measure to limit inhalation of this virus. While respirator facepieces were designed for single-use and disposal, the pandemic increased overall demand for N95 respirators, and corresponding manufacturing and supply chain limitations necessitated the safe reuse of respirators when necessary. In this study, we repurposed an aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP) system that is regularly utilized to decontaminate materials in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility, to develop methods for decontamination of N95 respirators. Results from virus inactivation, biological indicators, respirator fit testing, and filtration efficiency testing all indicated that the process was effective at rendering N95 respirators safe for reuse. This proof-of-concept study establishes baseline data for future testing of aHP in crisis capacity respirator-reuse scenarios.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="In response to the demand for N95 respirators by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated decontamination of N95 respirators using an aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP) system. This system is designed to dispense a consistent atomized spray of aerosolized, 7% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution over a treatment cycle. Multiple N95 respirator models were subjected to ten or more cycles of respirator decontamination, with a select number periodically assessed for qualitative and quantitative fit testing. In parallel, we assessed the ability of aHP treatment to inactivate multiple viruses absorbed onto respirators, including phi6 bacteriophage, HSV-1, CVB3, and SARS-CoV-2. For pathogens transmitted via respiratory droplets and aerosols, it is critical to address respirator safety for reuse. This study provided experimental validation of an aHP treatment process that decontaminates the respirators while maintaining N95 function. External NIOSH certification verified respirator structural integrity and filtration efficiency after ten rounds of aHP treatment. Virus inactivation by aHP was comparable to the decontamination of commercial spore-based biological indicators. These data demonstrate that the aHP process is effective, with successful fit-testing of respirators after multiple aHP cycles, effective decontamination of multiple virus species including SARS-CoV- 2, successful decontamination of bacterial spores, and filtration efficiency maintained at or greater than 95%. While this study did not include extended or clinical use of N95 respirators between aHP cycles, these data provide proof of concept for aHP decontamination of N95 respirators before reuse in a crisis-capacity scenario.

Importance The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented pressure on healthcare and research facilities to provide personal protective equipment. The respiratory nature of the SARS-CoV2 pathogen makes respirator facepieces a critical protection measure to limit inhalation of this virus. While respirator facepieces were designed for single-use and disposal, the pandemic increased overall demand for N95 respirators, and corresponding manufacturing and supply chain limitations necessitated the safe reuse of respirators when necessary. In this study, we repurposed an aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP) system that is regularly utilized to decontaminate materials in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility, to develop methods for decontamination of N95 respirators. Results from virus inactivation, biological indicators, respirator fit testing, and filtration efficiency testing all indicated that the process was effective at rendering N95 respirators safe for reuse. This proof-of-concept study establishes baseline data for future testing of aHP in crisis capacity respirator-reuse scenarios.

                             In response to the demand for N95 respirators by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated decontamination of N95 respirators using an aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP) system. This system is designed to dispense a consistent atomized spray of aerosolized, 7% hydrogen peroxide (H

                             ) solution over a treatment cycle. Multiple N95 respirator models were subjected to ten or more cycles of respirator decontamination, with a select number periodically assessed for qualitative and quantitative fit testing. In parallel, we assessed the ability of aHP treatment to inactivate multiple viruses absorbed onto respirators, including phi6 bacteriophage, HSV-1, CVB3, and SARS-CoV-2. For pathogens transmitted via respiratory droplets and aerosols, it is critical to address respirator safety for reuse. This study provided experimental validation of an aHP treatment process that decontaminates the respirators while maintaining N95 function. External NIOSH certification verified respirator structural integrity and filtration efficiency after ten rounds of aHP treatment. Virus inactivation by aHP was comparable to the decontamination of commercial spore-based biological indicators. These data demonstrate that the aHP process is effective, with successful fit-testing of respirators after multiple aHP cycles, effective decontamination of multiple virus species including SARS-CoV- 2, successful decontamination of bacterial spores, and filtration efficiency maintained at or greater than 95%. While this study did not include extended or clinical use of N95 respirators between aHP cycles, these data provide proof of concept for aHP decontamination of N95 respirators before reuse in a crisis-capacity scenario.

                              The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented pressure on healthcare and research facilities to provide personal protective equipment. The respiratory nature of the SARS-CoV2 pathogen makes respirator facepieces a critical protection measure to limit inhalation of this virus. While respirator facepieces were designed for single-use and disposal, the pandemic increased overall demand for N95 respirators, and corresponding manufacturing and supply chain limitations necessitated the safe reuse of respirators when necessary. In this study, we repurposed an aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP) system that is regularly utilized to decontaminate materials in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility, to develop methods for decontamination of N95 respirators. Results from virus inactivation, biological indicators, respirator fit testing, and filtration efficiency testing all indicated that the process was effective at rendering N95 respirators safe for reuse. This proof-of-concept study establishes baseline data for future testing of aHP in crisis capacity respirator-reuse scenarios.

                             The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic resulted in a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). In healthcare settings, the need for PPE is critical to protect frontline healthcare providers from infection, and to reduce cross- contamination between patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other uninfected patients. In healthcare settings, N95 filtering facepiece (FFP) respirators, including surgical N95 respirators, are used to provide protection from airborne infectious particles. The N95 terminology refers to the ability to block at least 95 percent of the most penetrating particle sizes (0.1 - 0.3 micron). Proper use of N95 respirators requires qualitative fit-testing (QLFT) or quantitative fit-testing (QNFT), which are designed to ensure a tight face-to-respirator seal for each specific wearer’s facial characteristics.

                             The shortage of N95 respirators resulted from limitations on the required raw materials, limited capacity to manufacture respirators, and the ability of supply and distribution chains to handle increased global demand. For this reason, researchers sought to demonstrate the potential for decontamination and reuse of existing N95 respirators. Standardized procedures are well- established for the decontamination and reuse of medical equipment, such as autoclaving, steam treatment, and chemical inactivation (e.g. bleach) (

                             ). Decontamination of most medical equipment is verified using spore-based biological indicators (

We also acquired real-time and diffusion sampler analyses of hydrogen peroxide levels throughout the decontamination process to monitor user safety.

                              We employed both qualitative (QLFT) and quantitative (QNFT) fit-testing. QLFT allowed repeated non-destructive testing across multiple rounds of decontamination, while QNFT provided numerical data on fit factor and ruled out any false negatives due to user fatigue. QLFT and QNFT was conducted after the first, fifth, and tenth decontamination cycles for both a male and female subject. These tests included a large number of 3M model 8511 respirators (for which we had the most available in the starting pool), and a smaller number of 5 other respirator models (

                              ). One respirator facepiece (3M model 1870+) experienced a broken strap after the eighth cycle of aHP; this respirator had passed QLFT successfully in earlier cycles but was excluded from final QNFT. No other failures occurred, therefore with 95% confidence, at least 95% of 3M model 8511 respirators maintained successful fit seal after ten aHP decontamination cycles. QNFT results with 3M model 8511 respirators passed the minimum passing fit factor of 100, and the maximum quantifiable fit factor of 200(+) in 8 of 9 tests. The numerical range of passing fit factors (100–200), and available sample quantity, limit any further statistical analysis. The successful fit- testing results indicate that repeated cycles of aHP decontamination do not interfere with respirator fit for reuse.

In particular, 8 of 9 QNFT results for the 3M model 8511 respirator surpassed a fit factor of 200, the maximum reportable by the test method – providing qualitative, yet objective, evidence of the safety margin related to fit integrity after 10 aHP decontamination cycles. All respirator models except Alpha Protech (which had inconsistent fit-test results; see Methods for details) passed all QLFT and QNFT to which they were subjected. Models Alpha ProTech (aHP cycle 1) and Kimberly Clark (aHP cycle 2) were only included for a single cycle and are thus not shown here.

Two additional unused, untreated 3M 8511 respirators were additionally tested and found with slightly reduced filtration efficiencies (94.4%, 94.6%), consistent with the respirator manufacturer’s 5-year shelf-life limitation. These data indicate that overall respirator performance was maintained over time and after aHP treatment.

                              Viral inactivation on respirator facepieces was anticipated to occur both by the passive process of drying or desiccation, and by the active process of aHP decontamination. Multiple virus species were included to test the decontamination potential of aHP against viruses in general, as well as against SARS-CoV-2. These included phi6, HSV-1, CVB3, and SARS-CoV-2 (see

                              Since passive viral inactivation by drying likely occurs during the time involved in decontamination, we measured the amount of virus remaining on inoculated but untreated N95 respirators. For each cycle of viral testing, the duration of passive viral inactivation was matched to the duration of the decontamination process (including aHP treatment, subsequent aeration, and transport). These “drying-only” samples confirmed a partial loss of viral infectiousness, ranging from 10-100-fold for phi6 and HSV-1, and 100-fold or greater for CVB3 and SARS- CoV-2 (

                              To model diverse routes of respirator exposure to viral pathogens during use, we inoculated viruses onto different N95 models and surfaces to thoroughly test for the ability of aHP to inactivate viruses. This included different regions of the respirator (e.g. outer vs. inner surface) to discern whether any differences in these fabrics would influence viral inactivation. This work was inspired by early efforts to verify viral inactivation in the context of N95 respirator surfaces, such as that of Kenney et al (

While most pathogens utilized here require propagation in mammalian cell lines at biosafety level 2 (BSL2), phi6 can be assayed more flexibly, using rapid bacterial cultures (24-hour turnaround) at biosafety level 1. Phi6 is a natural pathogen of the bacterial species Pseudomonas syringae pathovar phaseolicola, which is itself a pathogen of green beans. All viral species examined in this study were effectively decontaminated by aHP (

Together, the combination of respirator fit testing and virus inactivation testing used here indicate that aHP is a viable decontamination process to enable crisis-capacity reuse of N95 respirators during viral pandemics.

Once the user inputs the room’s cubic volume or dimensions, the CURIS unit calculates a suggested duration of charge and pulse periods. The standard aeration period is 3 hours, unless an auxiliary scavenging system or other space aeration system is utilized. To account for absorption of aHP into porous materials in the decontamination space (e.g. N95 respirators), a 30-40% increase in these default settings was initially used, as recommended by the manufacturer. Additionally, to ensure adequate contact time of disinfectant to the treated surfaces, a dwell period was added to the continuous and pulse charge periods. Based on initial results, adjustments in the charge, pulse, and dwell periods were made to optimize the decontamination process (

A total of seventy-seven 3M 8511 respirators were available for study purposes. A small number of respirators were allocated for QNFT and virology testing after QLFT, since these processes entailed respirator destruction (i.e. grommet insertion for QNFT or mask slicing for viral resuspension) and rendered them inaccessible for subsequent rounds of aHP.

Respirators were subjected to QLFT on the first, fifth, and tenth rounds of decontamination. A small number of respirators per model were allocated for QNFT during each round of fit testing; due to installation of metal grommet/probe for QNFT, these could not be reused for subsequent aHP cycles or fit testing.

This conditioning was intended to reflect active moisture load created by the respirator user. Following sealing of the respirator exhalation valve, and placing into the test instrument, full-load testing was performed. This testing included respirator challenge using 200 milligrams sodium chloride aerosol (mean count particle size distribution verified as 0.075 +/- 0.020 microns, with geometric standard deviation not exceeding 1.86). Sodium chloride aerosol was neutralized to a “Boltzman equilibrium state” (25 +/- 5°C, 30 +/- 10% relative humidity), and introduced at an airflow rate of 85 +/- 4 liters per minute, with periodic check and adjustment to maintain this flowrate. Instrumental analysis was conducted using a T.S.I Automated Filter Tester Model 8130A. Recorded data included flow rate, resistance, penetration, maximum penetration, and filtration efficiency.

Droplets were allowed to air-dry or absorb fully onto each respirator inside a Class II biosafety cabinet (BSC), before proceeding further. Selected samples of each virus-inoculated respirator were left in ambient conditions, without aHP decontamination, as a “drying-only” virus control. The remainder of each virus-inoculated facepiece was subjected to aHP decontamination as described above (i.e. “decontaminated” samples). For each round of viral testing, the duration of air-drying was matched to the duration of time needed for aHP treatment of parallel respirators (i.e. including transport, respirator staging in the Prep Room, aHP decontamination, aeration, and return to the viral testing location). After aHP treatment, respirators, each virus-inoculated area was cut out of the “dried” or “decontaminated” respirators using dissection scissors.

The mixture was quickly poured on top of a KB agar plate and dried in the biosafety cabinet before transferring to a 28°C incubator. Alternatively, for enumeration of “inoculum” and “dried” samples, soft agar Pph lawns were prepared and 10 µl dilutions of phage preparation were spotted. Plaque forming units (PFU) were enumerated after 24-48 hours of incubation at 28°C.

SARS-CoV-2 was spotted onto masks in quadruplicate and treated with aHP or left in ambient BSL3 conditions for drying-only controls. Respirator areas inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 were then excised and resuspended in 250 µL of DMEM supplemented with sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, antibiotics- antimycotics, and 2% FBS. After resuspension, viral titer was determined by tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay in 96-well plates, using Vero E6 cells. Briefly, 20 µL of resuspended sample was added to 4 wells containing 180 µL of resuspension media. The added samples were then serially diluted 10-fold down the plate, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 96-hours. At this time, cytopathic effect (CPE) was scored, and titer was calculated using the method of Reed and Muench (

                              Based on historical studies by the QNFT device and respirator manufacturers, N95 respirators have maximum breakthrough for particle sizes of 0.1 – 0.3 micron. Particles smaller or larger than this size range have increased filtration efficiency (greater than 95%). QNFT fit testing of N95 respirators therefore focuses on measuring this maximum penetration size range, to ensure that detectable leakage was due to facepiece seal leakage. OSHA has established a minimum QNFT passing fit factor of 100 for half-face respirators (including N95s or filtering-facepiece respirators) (

QNFT fit factors equal to or exceeding 200 are therefore reported as 200(+). The reported QNFT data were utilized to verify successful fit reported by QLFT.
