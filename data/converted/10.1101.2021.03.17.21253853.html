We aim to evaluate containment strategies that are sustainable and effective for LMICs. We constructed synthetic populations with varying contact and household structures to capture LMIC demographic characteristics that vary across communities. Using an agent- based model, we explored the optimal containment strategies for rural and urban communities by designing and simulating setting-specific strategies that deploy rapid diagnostic tests, symptom screening, contact tracing and physical distancing. In low-density rural communities, we found implementing either high quality (sensitivity > 50%) antigen rapid diagnostic tests or moderate physical distancing could contain the transmission. In urban communities, we demonstrated that both physical distancing and case finding are essential for containing COVID-19 (average infection rate < 10%). In high density communities that resemble slums and squatter settlements, physical distancing is less effective compared to rural and urban communities.

Our findings suggested that rapid diagnostic tests could be prioritised for control and monitor COVID-19 transmission and highlighted that contact survey data could guide strategy design to save resources for LMICs.

                             Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain of high potential for hotspots for COVID-19 deaths and emerging variants given the inequality of vaccine distribution and their vulnerable healthcare systems. We aim to evaluate containment strategies that are sustainable and effective for LMICs. We constructed synthetic populations with varying contact and household structures to capture LMIC demographic characteristics that vary across communities. Using an agent- based model, we explored the optimal containment strategies for rural and urban communities by designing and simulating setting-specific strategies that deploy rapid diagnostic tests, symptom screening, contact tracing and physical distancing. In low-density rural communities, we found implementing either high quality (sensitivity > 50%) antigen rapid diagnostic tests or moderate physical distancing could contain the transmission. In urban communities, we demonstrated that both physical distancing and case finding are essential for containing COVID-19 (average infection rate < 10%). In high density communities that resemble slums and squatter settlements, physical distancing is less effective compared to rural and urban communities. Lastly, we demonstrated contact tracing is essential for effective containment. Our findings suggested that rapid diagnostic tests could be prioritised for control and monitor COVID-19 transmission and highlighted that contact survey data could guide strategy design to save resources for LMICs. An accompanying open source R package is available for simulating COVID-19 transmission based on contact network models.

We evaluated the realistic combined strategy involving test and tracing using PCR and RDT, advising patients to self isolate, and physical distancing. Our simulation results suggest the level of containment required to contain COVID-19 depends on contact frequency in the communities. We also showed that antigen RDT and symptom-based diagnosis could be deployed in several settings for better containment outcomes. To help researchers replicate results with demographics that are not included in our analysis and to update the results using properties of new variants, we released an open-source R package for contact network based transmission simulation which accommodates customised parameter settings.

Additionally, we abstracted three representative community settings that have distinct demographics: (1) a rural community which represent geographies with low contact rates and medium household sizes; (2) an urban community which represent geographies with high contact rates and medium household sizes; (3) a high density community which represent high contact number and large household sizes, which aim to capture communities such as slums and squatter settlements.

The contact networks for the synthetic population were configured for the corresponding household structure, age-specific contact matrices, and geographical clustering, using an Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM).

A) Example outbreak in a network composed of 1000 individuals, simulated under the urban setting without NPI. The left, middle and right panel show the distributions of infected individuals (red dots) on day 20, day 30 and day 40 from the day that initial cases are imported. For visualisation purposes we fix the network structure across days here, while in our analysis a different contact network is sampled each day.

                              Our simulation assumes a test is always performed with close contact tracing and quarantine, unless specified otherwise. We assumed only close contacts of confirmed cases who consent to be isolated will be traced. Therefore, the overall quarantine rate is determined by the product of three parameters: isolation consent rate of the infector, tracing success rate (we assumed a tracing success rate equal to 100% for members within the same household of the infector), and quarantine consent rate of the contacts. Physical distancing was modelled by reducing the number of contacts outside the households. We simulated the effect of physical distancing by reducing the non-household contact number by 20% to 80% with 20% increments. We approximate the effective reproduction number Re under physical distancing by scaling Re proportionally to the average daily contact numbers.

                              In addition to individual containment measures, we also evaluated combined strategies based on current practice of COVID-19 testing. The combined strategies evaluated included 1) symptom-based isolation + PCR testing, 2) symptom-based isolation + antigen RDT, 3) and symptom-based isolation + PCR testing + antigen RDT. (

                              ) In practice, it does not introduce extra cost to suggest individuals who show up at the test centre with symptoms to self isolate. Therefore we assumed all three containment strategies are accompanied by symptom based isolation, which has a low compliance rate (20%). All three strategies were replicated with and without physical distancing for 200 outbreak trajectories to estimate the average daily incidence number. We simulated each trajectory for 100 days to guarantee that the transmission extincts within the synthetic population.

                              We found moderate physical distancing (permitting 60% of non-household contacts) could contain the outbreaks for geographies when the contact number is below 11, with infection rate equal to 15.4% [95% BCI 13.5% - 17.2%]. (

Only strict lockdown that reduces non-household contact number to 20% of that of normal could contain the outbreaks. (contact number = 20: infection rate = 5.1% [95% BCI 4.4% - 5.9%])

                              RDT or PCR alone could only mitigate the transmission in communities with less than 20 contacts, while combined with physical distancing, the mitigation effect increases, with 34.8% [95% BCI 33.3% - 36.3%] infection rate under moderate physical distancing. (contact number = 20, non-household contact rate= 60%) The mitigating effect increases as physical distancing gets stronger, with RDT slightly outperforming PCR tests. When simulating with a contact rate of 13, we found that using PCR or antigen RDT alone will isolate or quarantine more than 25% of the population and reduce the proportion of population infected as the isolation compliance rate increases.

                              Motivated by the improved containment effect of combining tests with social distancing, we further evaluated combined strategies based on practice. Firstly, we assume patients who show up at the test centre with symptoms will be advised to isolate and told their contact to isolate (symptome-based isolation), which is modelled at a low compliance rate (
                              <a id="xref-table-wrap-2-3" class="xref-table" href="#T2">

                              ); Secondly, we assumed a patient could provide sample for both a RDT and a PCR test. To contrast the contact structure between populations, we focused on three representative communities abstracted from contact data. We found that the symptom+PCR has approximately similar performance as symptom+RDT, while symptom+PCR+RDT has better performance in all three community settings. (

                              ) In rural settings, either symptom+PCR or symptom+RDT could contain the outbreaks (symptom+PCR: 4.3% infected [95% BCI: 3.6% - 4.9%],

                              ). In urban settings, symptom+PCR+RDT could suppress infection rate to 32.6% [95% BCI: 31.4% - 33.7%], while with physical distancing reduces non-household contact number by 40%, either symptom+PCR or RDT could contain the outbreaks. Notably, physical distancing could effectively flatten the curve in urban communities, (

                              ) while the effect is less prominent in high density communities. Combined, these results show that affordable options such as RDT could be sufficient for low-density geographies similar to the rural settings, whereas testing and tracing programmes need to be combined with physical distancing to achieve containment in more densely populated areas similar to the urban settings.

To quantify the probability that imported cases do not start an outbreak, we defined the stochastic extinction events as the trajectories that infected less than 5% of the population. Under the three settings considered, the probability of stochastic extinction increases when testing, isolation and quarantine are implemented. In rural settings, symptom+RDT would increase the probability of stochastic extinction from 29% to 70%. In urban settings, the stochastic extinction events happened in 62% of the trajectories when physical distancing and symptom+RDT+PCR are implemented, which is a much larger proportion compared to 0.5% when no NPI is implemented. In the high density settings, the stochastic extinction probability remains low even when physical distancing and symptom+RDT+PCR are all implemented (13.5%). We verified that the probability of stochastic extinction does not depend on simulated population size. (

                             Our primary goal is to prioritise tools for LMICs to protect themselves against COVID-19, where we highlighted four interconnected elements: community knowledge, RDT, physical distancing, and contact tracing. These elements could be utilised to address two pressing challenges in LMICs. Firstly, how to design a cost-effective strategy for LMICs to reduce the financial burden of controlling the transmission of COVID-19? Secondly, how to design setting-specific surveillance or containment programmes that account for geographical variability in LMICs

                             ? We argue that community knowledge about demographics and contact structure is a valuable resource that could facilitate government decision making. For example, if a community is known to be densely populated and have crowded households, our results suggest that physical distancing is expected to be less effective there. As another example, if survey data suggested some communities have less indoor contacts than average, we would expect a light containment strategy such as mild physical distancing alone could work effectively, thus saving resources from an over-stringent strategy. In practice, policy makers could perform contact surveys in representative communities and use them to construct a classification system. Our analyses present the trends of transmission dynamics and containment effectiveness across different contact numbers and demographics. When used in combination with community knowledge, our results could guide policy design that achieves the best outcomes while saving resources.

                             Antigen RDT has several desirable properties for application in LMICs. It is cheap, easy to distribute, has quick turnarounds, and doesn’t require lab facilities. LMICs require consistent containment to protect their health systems from being overwhelmed, which makes RDT an ideal choice to avoid huge financial costs. Specifically, RDT might be prioritised in resource-limited regions where contact number is low and performing PCR tests is prohibitive. Though containing power subjects to the test sensitivity and community scenario, our results suggested high quality kits that have a sensitivity above 50% will provide similar containment power shown in the simulation. However, the detrimental effect of false negative and false positive results might negate the containment effects.

                             We also want to emphasise that policy design should serve its goals. If aiming at a zero-COVID policy, such as those deployed by China (as of March 5th, 2022), our results show that contact tracing is an essential element to implement, which relies on abundant personnel and quarantine capacities. However, if the goal is to flatten the curve to avoid overwhelmed health systems, mild-physical distancing is an effective measure which saves resources and might serve the young population of LMICs better. If the goal is to monitor the transmission for early alarm of new variants and prepare for outbreaks, mass RDT tests could detect abnormal outbreaks that link to new variants and auxiliary PCR tests could monitor prevalence of each variant. Successful containment strategy should apply community knowledge to serve the goal, whether it is suppressing, delaying, or monitoring the transmission of COVID-19.

                               Summary of averaged outbreak trajectories in rural, urban and high density settings. A-B) Averaged trajectories of outbreaks under rural setting and those with three NPI containing strategies. Left panel shows the simulation without physical distancing and the right panel shows simulation with a physical distancing that blocks 40% of non-household contacts. C-D) Same averaged trajectories under urban setting; Left panel shows simulation without physical distancing and right panel shows simulation with a physical distancing that blocks 40% of non-household contacts. E-F) Same averaged trajectories under high density community setting; Left panel shows simulation without physical distancing and right panel shows simulation with a physical distancing that blocks 40% of non-household contacts. The curves are the mean value of daily infected numbers for a synthetic population of 1000; The shaded area indicated the 95% confidence interval of the estimation; Both mean and confidence intervals are computed from 200 simulated outbreaks.

                               Evaluation of close contact tracing and delayed responses. A) Proportion of total infected individuals who are either isolated by testing (red dots) or quarantined by tracing (green dots) varies as the compliance rate of quarantine a close contact of a confirmed case changes. B) Implementation of containing measures after a certain proportion of the population was infected could still protect a proportion of the population, compared to the circumstances with no intervention. All simulations are performed for rural, urban and high desnity settings.
