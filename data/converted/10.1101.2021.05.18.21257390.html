  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Childhood abuse might impair corticolimbic brain regions, which play a crucial role in emotion processing and the acute stress response. Yet few has explored the relationship between childhood stress, emotion processing and acute stress reactivity despite the overlapping brain regions of the last two. Here, we examine the relationships between distinct dimensions of childhood adversity (i.e., deprivation and threat) and emotion processing as well as acute stress response. Furthermore, we explore whether emotion processing (particularly threatening information), which might be particularly relevant for adaptive stress responding among individuals with experience of childhood abuse, mediates the relationship between childhood stress and acute stress response.

Method Fifty-one young adults completed a free-viewing task to evaluate neural response to negative stimuli measured by late positive potential (LPP) of ERPs (Event-related potentials). In a separate day, heart rate and salivary cortisol were collected during a social-evaluative stress challenge (i.e., TSST, Trier Social Stress Test). After the TSST, childhood trauma questionnaire was measured to indicate the level of abuse (as a proxy of threat) and neglect (as a proxy of deprivation) dimensions.

Results Higher level of childhood abuse (but not neglect) was distinctly related to smaller LPP amplitudes to negative stimuli, as well as smaller heart rate reactivity to acute stress. For these participants, smaller LPP amplitudes linked with smaller heart rate reactivity to acute stress. Furthermore, decreased LPP amplitudes to negative stimuli mediated the relationship between higher level of childhood abuse and blunted heart rate reactivity to stress.

Conclusions Consistent with the dimensional model of childhood stress, our study showed that childhood abuse is distinctly associated with neural as well as physiological response to threat. Furthermore, the blunted neural response to negative stimuli might be the underlying mechanism in which childhood abuse leads to blunted acute stress response. Considering that all the participants are healthy in the present study, the blunted processing of negative stimuli might rather reflect adaptation instead of vulnerability, in order to prevent stress overshooting in the face of frequent early-life threatening experiences.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background Childhood abuse might impair corticolimbic brain regions, which play a crucial role in emotion processing and the acute stress response. Yet few has explored the relationship between childhood stress, emotion processing and acute stress reactivity despite the overlapping brain regions of the last two. Here, we examine the relationships between distinct dimensions of childhood adversity (i.e., deprivation and threat) and emotion processing as well as acute stress response. Furthermore, we explore whether emotion processing (particularly threatening information), which might be particularly relevant for adaptive stress responding among individuals with experience of childhood abuse, mediates the relationship between childhood stress and acute stress response.

Method Fifty-one young adults completed a free-viewing task to evaluate neural response to negative stimuli measured by late positive potential (LPP) of ERPs (Event-related potentials). In a separate day, heart rate and salivary cortisol were collected during a social-evaluative stress challenge (i.e., TSST, Trier Social Stress Test). After the TSST, childhood trauma questionnaire was measured to indicate the level of abuse (as a proxy of threat) and neglect (as a proxy of deprivation) dimensions.

Results Higher level of childhood abuse (but not neglect) was distinctly related to smaller LPP amplitudes to negative stimuli, as well as smaller heart rate reactivity to acute stress. For these participants, smaller LPP amplitudes linked with smaller heart rate reactivity to acute stress. Furthermore, decreased LPP amplitudes to negative stimuli mediated the relationship between higher level of childhood abuse and blunted heart rate reactivity to stress.

Conclusions Consistent with the dimensional model of childhood stress, our study showed that childhood abuse is distinctly associated with neural as well as physiological response to threat. Furthermore, the blunted neural response to negative stimuli might be the underlying mechanism in which childhood abuse leads to blunted acute stress response. Considering that all the participants are healthy in the present study, the blunted processing of negative stimuli might rather reflect adaptation instead of vulnerability, in order to prevent stress overshooting in the face of frequent early-life threatening experiences.

                              Childhood abuse might impair corticolimbic brain regions, which play a crucial role in emotion processing and the acute stress response. Yet few has explored the relationship between childhood stress, emotion processing and acute stress reactivity despite the overlapping brain regions of the last two. Here, we examine the relationships between distinct dimensions of childhood adversity (i.e., deprivation and threat) and emotion processing as well as acute stress response. Furthermore, we explore whether emotion processing (particularly threatening information), which might be particularly relevant for adaptive stress responding among individuals with experience of childhood abuse, mediates the relationship between childhood stress and acute stress response.

                              Fifty-one young adults completed a free-viewing task to evaluate neural response to negative stimuli measured by late positive potential (LPP) of ERPs (Event-related potentials). In a separate day, heart rate and salivary cortisol were collected during a social-evaluative stress challenge (i.e., TSST, Trier Social Stress Test). After the TSST, childhood trauma questionnaire was measured to indicate the level of abuse (as a proxy of threat) and neglect (as a proxy of deprivation) dimensions.

                              Higher level of childhood abuse (but not neglect) was distinctly related to smaller LPP amplitudes to negative stimuli, as well as smaller heart rate reactivity to acute stress. For these participants, smaller LPP amplitudes linked with smaller heart rate reactivity to acute stress. Furthermore, decreased LPP amplitudes to negative stimuli mediated the relationship between higher level of childhood abuse and blunted heart rate reactivity to stress.

                              Consistent with the dimensional model of childhood stress, our study showed that childhood abuse is distinctly associated with neural as well as physiological response to threat. Furthermore, the blunted neural response to negative stimuli might be the underlying mechanism in which childhood abuse leads to blunted acute stress response. Considering that all the participants are healthy in the present study, the blunted processing of negative stimuli might rather reflect adaptation instead of vulnerability, in order to prevent stress overshooting in the face of frequent early-life threatening experiences.

                             Exposure to different types of childhood stress, ranging from physical, emotional, sexual abuse, and emotional and physical neglect, is widespread with a prevalence of 30%-53% across the globe (

                             ). To date, the mechanisms underlying the long-lasting influence of childhood stress on health remain unclear. A putative neurobiological mechanism through which childhood stress may increase the risk for psychopathology is by altering stress response, i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) with end product of cortisol and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) (

                             Altogether, these studies suggest a possible link among childhood stress, emotion processing and acute stress response. However, only a limited number of studies so far have examined these associations. For example,

However, no direct relationship between childhood stress and white matter integrity in the frontolimbic tracts was found. Results from

                             showed that among unmedicated young women (mean age 26.41) with variable psychiatric diagnoses, higher severity of threat-related childhood stress was associated with altered resting-state functional connectivity within corticolimbic circuits, which in turn was related to blunted cortisol response to acute stress. However, both these two studies only assessed structure and resting state of brain regions associated with rather than a direct measurement of emotion processing, and they only focused on cortisol response to acute stress. Therefore, in our current study, we used a free viewing paradigm to measure emotion processing with the ERP method and we both measure cortisol (represents HPA axis) and heart rate (represents ANS) in the acute response in healthy young participants. The utilizing of this specific sample was to exclude the possible influence of psychiatric condition and developmental stage (

The link between stress and corticolimbic functioning is bidirectional, such that crucial corticolimbic brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala) not only are impaired by chronic stress but also play a crucial role in neuroendocrine and autonomic regulation and thus the acute stress response (

Specifically, we predicted that neural processing of negative stimuli (indicated by LPP amplitudes) would mediate the effects of childhood threat and acute stress response.

Considering potential influences on stress responses, all participants were pre-screened and excluded according to the following criteria: major chronic physiological disease or endocrine disorder; history of psychiatric or neurological disorders; symptoms of chronic anxiety, depression or insomnia; chronic use of psychiatric, neurological, or endocrine medicine; chronic overnight work or irregular day/night patterns; any medication use within three days before participating in the study; current periodontitis; excessive consumption of alcohol (more than two alcoholic drinks a day) or nicotine (more than five cigarettes a day).

They were also informed that their performance would be videotaped and evaluated. After preparation, participants were escorted to laboratory room B, where three experimenters (two females) in white coats pretending to be managers were presented. After the speech, participants were asked to complete a mental arithmetic task, which was to subtract serially the number 13 starting at 1022 as fast and accurate as possible. Once an error was made, participants had to restart at 1022. Throughout the speech and arithmetic task, participants spoke into a microphone and a video camera in front of the three experimenters.

                              For the emotion processing, to increase stability of the data, the mean LPP amplitude was calculated by averaging the LPP amplitude across the P1, Pz, and P2 electrodes. To validate the valence effect on the LPP amplitude, a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA with valence (negative vs. neutral) as within-subjects factor was performed. Then, the LPP difference waves (ΔLPP) was calculated by subtracting neutral from negative LPPs to serve as an ERP index of emotional processing.

                              For the stress reactivity, to evaluate physiological stress reactivity to the TSST, repeated-measures ANOVAs were first performed on salivary cortisol levels and HR with the measurement time point as the within-subject variable. Greenhouse-Geisser correction was employed when sphericity assumption in the ANOVA for repeated measures was violated. Bonferroni correction was used in post-hoc multiple comparisons. Then, heart rate increase (ΔHR) was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the average HR of the TSST. The area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) of cortisol was computed to indicate the HPA response to stress (

The dependent variables were acute stress reactivity index (i.e., ΔHR and cortisol AUCg). Furthermore, in order to test the hypothesis that abuse and neglect are distinctly associated with emotion processing and acute stress reactivity, we used a conservative method by examining the overlap of CIs from abuse and neglect. In the event that the CIs overlapped by less than 50% of one CI arm, the beta weights would be considered statistically significantly different from each other (p < 0.05,

Thirdly, to explore the relationship between emotion processing and acute stress reactivity (path 3), hierarchical regression analyses with bootstrap (n = 1000 times of resampling with replacement) were then conducted to investigate the predicting value of the ΔLPP amplitudes on the stress response (i.e., ΔHR and cortisol AUCg).

                               We first found that only the level of childhood abuse is significantly associated with blunted emotion processing (ΔLPP amplitudes) and blunted heart rate response to stress (ΔHR). Then, we ran a mediation model to test whether emotion process mediated the association of childhood abuse and HR reactivity to the TSST. Adjusting for sex and trait anxiety, a significant indirect effect of abuse through blunted emotion processing to HR reactivity was observed (95%CI: -0.325, -0.002) (

Therefore, higher level of childhood abuse predicting smaller heart rate response to acute stress was fully mediated by blunted processing of negative stimuli.

                             In this study, we found that higher level of childhood abuse (as a proxy of threat) but not neglect (as a proxy of deprivation) was distinctly associated with blunted neural reactivity to negative stimuli (as indicated by smaller LPP amplitudes) on the one hand, and with blunted HR response to acute psychosocial stress on the other hand. Smaller LPP amplitudes was also related with blunted HR acute stress response. Furthermore, the mediation model showed that childhood abuse predicted blunted HR response through blunted neural reactivity to negative stimuli. These results even hold after controlling sex and trait anxiety, in a sample of healthy young adults.

                             ). Consistently, we found that enhanced LPP amplitudes to negative compared to neutral pictures were associated with higher HR responses to acute psychosocial stress. It adds to the evidence that negative bias plays a causal role in stress vulnerability (e.g.,

                             ). For example, prior fMRI and EPR studies found that relatively exaggerated amygdala reactivity and increased LPP amplitude towards negative stimuli before trauma exposure were predictive to posttraumatic symptoms in response to traumatic stressors (

                             When adding the factor of childhood stress, our results showed that childhood abuse is associated with smaller LPP amplitudes to negative stimuli as well as smaller HR reactivity to acute stress. As the theoretical model has proposed, childhood threat as in abusive conditions may differentiate in shaping neurobiological development, such that abuse exposure influences the development of cortico-limbic circuits that underlie salience processing (

                             ). Consistent with the model, we found that childhood abuse but not neglect was distinctly related with blunted processing to negative stimuli on the one hand, and with blunted heart rate response to acute stress on the other hand. This effect, to some extent, was in line with previous studies that abused children tended to avoid negative information shown as biased attention away from threat (

                             ). Meanwhile, the current result also echoed with one previous study from our own lab that childhood abuse rather than neglect was associated with blunted motivational evaluation of self-inflicted errors among healthy young males (
                             <a id="xref-ref-88-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-88">

                             ). Furthermore, our mediation analysis showed that childhood abuse predicted blunted HR response through blunted processing to negative stimuli. Considering that the role of amygdala sensitivity in both emotion processing and autonomic stress response as we discussed above, the blunted amygdala with higher level of childhood abuse might be the underlying neural mechanism. Specifically, individuals with higher level of childhood abuse might show diminished amygdala response revealed as smaller LPP reactivity to negative stimuli, which further lead to smaller autonomic response to acute psychosocial stressor-the universal negative event.

                             Given the healthy characteristic of our participants, results of blunted salience processing in the current study could be explained by the cortical and cognitive adaptation mechanism, i.e., following iterative exposure to threat, the response to negative events might become habituated or downregulated in order to prevent stress overshoot (
                             <a id="xref-ref-33-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-33">

                             ). Accordingly, a recent scoping review showed that resilient adults after childhood adversity (i.e., those reporting childhood maltreatment without psychopathology) demonstrated improved ability to regulate emotions through medial prefrontal cortex-amygdala downregulation, lower hippocampal activation to emotional faces, and increased amygdala habituation to stress (
                             <a id="xref-ref-59-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-59">

                             </a>
                             ). Similarly, a study found that higher trait resilience was related with blunted negative emotion processing indicated by smaller LPP amplitudes (
                             <a id="xref-ref-11-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">

                             ). In other words, our study suggested that dampened threat processing (indicated by smaller LPP reactivity to negative stimuli) might rather reflect resilience to childhood abuse in young adults, and this dampened threat processing further leads to diminished stress responses (indicated by smaller HR response to acute stress).

                             There are some limitations to the current study. First, we only used the retrospective self-reported questionnaire, which might not be a precise way to measure childhood stress. Participants with enhanced emotion processing might have a negative recall bias, in turn, report more severity of childhood stress. By controlling trait anxiety level, we might be able to, to some extent, partial out the effects of personality on recall bias and stress response. Furthermore, although the CTQ is a commonly used instrument for assessment of childhood stress, it does not include the information about the time the adversity occurred. Therefore, it limits our understanding of the specific developmental stage (s) of adversity exposure, which is a crucial factor on the effect of childhood stress on brain and cognitive development (

                             In conclusion, building on the previous work, the current study explored the two dimensions of childhood stress on negative emotion processing and acute stress response among the same group of healthy young adults. The results revealed that the severity of childhood abuse is uniquely associated with blunted emotion processing and blunted acute stress response, and blunted emotion processing significantly mediates the relationship between childhood abuse and acute stress response. Considering that all the participants are healthy, the blunted processing to negative stimuli might reflect adaptive responses to prevent stress overshooting in the face of frequent early-life threatening experiences.
