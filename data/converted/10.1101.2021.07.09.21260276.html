Near real-time data on the food insecurity situation collected by international organizations such as the World Food Programme can be crucial to monitor and forecast time trends of insufficient food consumption levels in countries at risk. Here, using food consumption observations in combination with secondary data on conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks, we build a forecasting model based on gradient boosted regression trees to create predictions on the evolution of insufficient food consumption trends up to 30 days in to the future in 6 countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mali, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen). Results show that the number of available historical observations is a key element for the forecasting model performance. Among the 6 countries studied in this work, for those with the longest food insecurity time series, that is Syria and Yemen, the proposed forecasting model allows to forecast the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption up to 30 days into the future with higher accuracy than a naive approach based on the last measured prevalence only. The framework developed in this work could provide decision makers with a tool to assess how the food insecurity situation will evolve in the near future in countries at risk. Results clearly point to the added value of continuous near real-time data collection at sub-national level.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Food insecurity, defined as the lack of physical or economic access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food, remains one of the main challenges included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Near real-time data on the food insecurity situation collected by international organizations such as the World Food Programme can be crucial to monitor and forecast time trends of insufficient food consumption levels in countries at risk. Here, using food consumption observations in combination with secondary data on conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks, we build a forecasting model based on gradient boosted regression trees to create predictions on the evolution of insufficient food consumption trends up to 30 days in to the future in 6 countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mali, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen). Results show that the number of available historical observations is a key element for the forecasting model performance. Among the 6 countries studied in this work, for those with the longest food insecurity time series, that is Syria and Yemen, the proposed forecasting model allows to forecast the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption up to 30 days into the future with higher accuracy than a naive approach based on the last measured prevalence only. The framework developed in this work could provide decision makers with a tool to assess how the food insecurity situation will evolve in the near future in countries at risk. Results clearly point to the added value of continuous near real-time data collection at sub-national level.

                             Food insecurity, defined as the lack of physical or economic access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food, remains one of the main challenges included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Near real-time data on the food insecurity situation collected by international organizations such as the World Food Programme can be crucial to monitor and forecast time trends of insufficient food consumption levels in countries at risk. Here, using food consumption observations in combination with secondary data on conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks, we build a forecasting model based on gradient boosted regression trees to create predictions on the evolution of insufficient food consumption trends up to 30 days in to the future in 6 countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mali, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen). Results show that the number of available historical observations is a key element for the forecasting model performance. Among the 6 countries studied in this work, for those with the longest food insecurity time series, that is Syria and Yemen, the proposed forecasting model allows to forecast the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption up to 30 days into the future with higher accuracy than a naive approach based on the last measured prevalence only. The framework developed in this work could provide decision makers with a tool to assess how the food insecurity situation will evolve in the near future in countries at risk. Results clearly point to the added value of continuous near real-time data collection at sub-national level.

                             Food insecurity is also a global public health challenge. Household food insecurity is the leading risk factor of malnutrition, claiming approximately 300 000 deaths each year. Whether directly or indirectly, due to inadequate food consumption and poor diet quality, it is also accountable for over half of all deaths among children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Among the various determinants of food insecurity in relation to child malnutrition, the main ones are socio-demographic characteristics as well as food prices [

                             From a policy perspective, food insecurity will remain a worldwide concern for the next 50 years and beyond. As a 20-year old article in Science stated: “Recently, crop yield has fallen in many areas because of declining investments in research and infrastructure, as well as increasing water scarcity. Climate change and HIV/AIDS are also crucial factors affecting food security in many regions. Although agroecological approaches offer some promise for improving yields, food security in developing countries could be substantially improved by increased investment and policy reforms” [

                             ]. In the past twenty years, the situation has however significantly worsened and agroecological technologies are not keeping up with the accelerating effects of climate change that, ever increasingly, are affecting countries and populations on much shorter scales (weeks and months rather than years) than in the past.

                             Therefore, an essential step towards achieving hunger reduction is to have access to frequent, up-to-date information on the status of food insecurity in countries facing humanitarian crises, and to estimates of where and when the situation is likely to improve or deteriorate, in order to allow for informed and timely decision-making on resource allocation and on relevant policies and programmes. For this reason, governments and international organizations perform food security assessments on a regular basis, by means of face-to-face surveys and, increasingly, through computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI), or technologies like interactive voice response and web surveys. The World Food Programme (WFP) is currently monitoring the food security situation in near-real time in a number of countries at the sub-national level, collecting on a daily basis, through remote phone surveys, information on levels of food consumption and food-based coping, as well as other relevant indicators [

This unprecedented availability of daily sub-national level data paves the way for new possibilities since it not only allows for a continuous up-to-date picture of the current situation, but could also be used to build predictive models to forecast how the situation will evolve in the future. In this study, we explore the forecastability of insufficient food consumption levels, and show, specifically for Syria and Yemen, that satisfactory predictions up to 30 days into the future can be obtained when enough daily sub-national level historical data is available. Having access to regular real-time estimation of how the situation is likely to evolve in the near future would allow WFP for more informed discussions on need-based humanitarian assistance allocation decisions.

This metric, characterizing a given area at a given time, is defined as the prevalence of households, in the specified area and time period, that are identified to have poor or borderline food consumption. Such prevalence is computed from a representative number of household surveys enquiring about one of the core house-hold food insecurity indicators, namely the Food Consumption Score (FCS), which captures households’ dietary diversity and nutrient intake [

Our main goal is not to replace these efforts, but rather to complement them with an approach that, once improved as more data becomes available, could be used to provide rapidly available forecasts for several places at the time by automatically feeding near real-time data to the proposed algorithms.

                              , in the six countries, time trends of insufficient food consumption display noisy and irregular patterns, underscoring the complex dynamics underlying food insecurity. During the study period, all countries experienced large fluctuations in the prevalence of insufficient food consumption, and such variations were not uniform between sub-national administrative units. In Cameroon, for instance, only a few regions were characterized by a relatively high proportion of food insecure people, generally above 50%, but also exhibiting large fluctuations, such as the rapid decline and subsequent increase observed in the North-West regions. On the other hand, in Syria, the sub-national trends were all similar in terms of relative changes in the affected population, with a general upward trend affecting almost every province beginning in July 2020. In the governorates of Yemen, for which the longest time series are available, the proportion of the population affected by food insecurity varied between 20% and 60% during the years 2018-2022, however, a common national time trend is less recognizable. It should be noted that some of these irregularities could also be partially due to the effects of sampling and selection bias, whose mitigation can rarely be achieved in full.

Such frequency distribution is then used to assess the predictability of the time series by computing the Shannon entropy associated with the distribution of permutation patterns in the symbols defined above. In the Methods section we provide a complete formal definition of the PE and its computation. It has been shown that PE can be considered as a measure of intrinsic predictability of a time series and its value is positively associated with forecasting error [
                              <a id="xref-ref-54-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-54">

                              ]. Intuitively, PE quantifies the information that is transmitted from the past to the present state of a time series: a time series that periodically visits the same few symbols among the many possible will have a low entropy and its present state will be easily determined from the past. A random time series that uniformly samples the symbols with equal probability will have a high entropy and its future will not be predictable from past states.

                              Following from the observation that insufficient food consumption trends are not highly predictable from their own history, we explore whether secondary information can be used to enhance our ability to predict their future evolution. To this end, we revert to information on the key drivers of food insecurity: conflict/physical insecurity, extreme weather events and economic shocks [

                              ]. We build a set of indicators covering these three domains and develop a forecasting model based on gradient boosted regression trees (XGBoost) [

                              ] to make predictions on how the insufficient food consumption trend will evolve up to 30 days into the future. More specifically, in our model we consider as predictors of insufficient food consumption the following indicators (see Methods and the Supplementary Information file for a full description). First, we include daily time series of the prevalence of people using crisis or above crisis food-based coping, which is obtained from another core food insecurity indicator, the reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI), by measuring the share of households with rCSI ≥ 19 [

                              ]. Since political unrest can affect food security, we include in our model daily time series of fatalities due to conflict or political violence as reported by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) [

                              ]. Economic shocks are included into the model by considering monthly variations in the price of cereals and tubers in local currency. The model takes into account the effects of weather events and climate conditions by including time series of rainfall, of its anomaly with respect to long-term averages (over 1 and 3 months), and time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a standard satellite-based measure of vegetation coverage that is commonly used for drought assessment [

                              ], and of NDVI anomaly. Finally, since the food consumption behavior of most of the population in several African and Asian countries is affected by Ramadan, we include a time series that marks the days of the Ramadan period that fall within the time window used to measure people’s food consumption.

                              Over short forecasting horizons, typically less than 14 days, a naive approach proves to be a good enough predictor as we do not expect food consumption to suddenly change from one day to the next. However, as we try to forecast further into the future, we see that the forecasting model starts to outperform the naive approach, as shown in

                              Given the relatively poor predictive performance of our models in countries with short time series of insufficient food consumption, we systematically examine how the performance varies as a function of the length of the time series available to train the model and of spatial coverage, indicating the number of sub-national areas. We find that, compared to the naive approach, the performance of our model dramatically increases with the number of available training points, which is given by the product of the two dimensions above: temporal length and spatial coverage (see

                              ). Moreover, with a given size of the training set, the proposed model tends to perform better than the naive approach as the forecasting horizon grows, demonstrating that, as expected, the model is better at predicting further into the future than just considering the last available measurement. However, this effect is evident only when a large training set is available (as in the case of Yemen, with more than 20,000 data points), and a small training set reduces the benefit of the model even over longer time horizons.

                              A limitation of this analysis relies on the fact that in our dataset different numbers of training points coincide with different countries, which does not allow to disentangle effects due to the local context from those due to temporal length and spatial coverage. We therefore performed further analyses in order to separately investigate the role played by the number of covered areas and by the time series length. First, we considered the same time series length for all countries by using as starting date for all of them the earliest date available for all countries. In this setting, the difference in the number of training points among the different countries is only due to the different number of areas covered. Results are reported in Supplementary Fig. S6a. Secondly, we considered instead the full time series but we fixed the number of considered areas to the minimum number of areas available for all countries (in this case we had to exclude Nigeria since only three areas are covered there, which would have been too few for the analysis). In this setting, the difference in the number of training points among the different countries is only due to different lengths of the available time series. Results are reported in Fig. S6b. In both cases, we re-trained and tested the model using, each time, a different data subset, as described above. Results show that the performance of the model still increases with the dimension under study (the length of the time series and the number of covered areas), confirming our initial results.

                             In this study we addressed the critical challenge of forecasting the daily evolution of a food security indicator, namely the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption, as measured by WFP. The problem promptly proved difficult given that the analyzed time series exhibit noisy and irregular behavior. This is to be expected since food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East is a highly dynamic phenomenon, comprising a seasonal component related to agricultural production calendars and religious observances such as Ramadan (during which consumption patterns are completely altered), but also subject to swift changes when external shocks hit, such as the emergence of conflict, extreme weather events or economic shocks [

                             Therefore, forecasting based solely on information on the historical evolution of the target indicator over time would not be successful, as demonstrated through a permutation entropy analysis. Hence, we extended the proposed framework to include historical information on the key drivers of food insecurity and built models that comprise both endogenous (insufficient food consumption itself, as well as food-based coping information) and exogenous factors (conflict-related fatalities, rainfall and vegetation and their anomalies, staple food prices and Ramadan’s occurrence). We showed that the proposed model makes it possible to forecast the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption up to 30 days into the future with higher accuracy than a naive approach solely based on the last measured prevalence, at least in places where enough training data are available to inform the model. The number of available historical observations proved to be a key element in forecasting success. Even for places with more than 10,000 available training points, which is not an extremely large number but still enough to provide reasonable results in other contexts [

                             ]. Finally, fore-casting models could benefit from the inclusion of additional external predictors and in particular from the availability of novel data streams, such as mobile phone data or the automated text mining of news [

                             In conclusion, our study presents a simple, yet fundamental message for governments and humanitarian organizations on the power of the data they collect: collecting data on a regular basis for long enough periods of time and across enough different geographic areas does not only make it possible to monitor the evolution of a situation in near real-time but also to inform forecasting models that would make it possible to produce estimates of how the situation is likely to evolve in the near future. This means that decision makers would have access in advance to information on areas most at risk of a deterioration in the food security situation, allowing for a more timely response. Predictions should of course be used with caution and considered only as an indication of what may happen in the near future, hence informing pre-paredness efforts by suggesting a need for further in-depth assessments of the food security situation.

                              The indicator whose time-evolution we aim to predict is the daily prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption in a given sub-national geographical area.

                              ]. The FCS is obtained through household surveys by asking how often, during the previous 7 days, a household has consumed food items from different food groups (main staples, pulses, vegetables, fruit, meat and fish, milk, sugar, oil and condiments). Consumption frequencies are then summed up in a weighted fashion, where each food group is weighted according to its nutritional level (with more nutritious foods having higher weights), resulting in the FCS. Thresholds are then applied to label each household as having poor, borderline or acceptable food consumption (as further detailed in Section A of the Supplementary Information), allowing to eventually compute the prevalence of people in a given area with insufficient (i.e. poor or borderline) food consumption.

They initially utilize Random-Digit Dialing (RDD) to obtain the most random selection of respondents as possible, while applying some filters to ensure the required geographic and sociodemographic distributions (i.e. not all households reached are actually interviewed, only those matching the specific characteristics needed).

                              In order to compute a statistically representative prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption at sub-national and daily resolution, a rolling window approach is used. That is, for each geographical area, the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption for a given day is obtained as the weighted share of households with poor or borderline food consumption interviewed during the previous d days, where d varies by country (values are reported in Supplementary Table S2). Missing values in the time series are inferred through linear interpolation. Post-stratification weights are applied by WFP to compute the final share of households with poor or borderline food consumption in a given area and time window, in order to mitigate sampling and modality bias, as detailed in [

                              ]. This is done through weighting of the data to account for the under-representation of certain demographics. Population weights are applied to compensate for administrative areas that are under- or over-sampled, while demographic weights are introduced to mitigate selection bias and compensate for under-represented households (e.g. low-income or less-educated households). The final weight is given by the product of the two, when both need to be applied.

The closer to 1 the χ is, the more regular and more deterministic the time series is. Contrarily, the smaller χ is, the more noisy the time series is. As suggested by Scarpino & Petri [

Focusing on the predictability over short timescales, we average H over temporal windows by selecting 1,000 random points from each time series and calculating H for windows of length 10, 11, 12, …, 100 days.

The rCSI is obtained through household surveys by asking if and how often, during the previous 7 days, a household had to adopt the following coping behaviors: relying on less preferred or less expensive food, borrowing food from relatives or friends, limiting portion sizes, restricting adults’ consumption in order for small children to eat and reducing the number of meals eaten in a day. The rCSI is then obtained as a weighted sum of these frequencies, where weights are based on the severity of the strategy, as further detailed in Section B of the Supplementary Information. The survey data used to build this variable is the same as for the target indicator. A rolling window approach to compute a statistically representative prevalence of people using crisis or above crisis food-based coping at sub-national and daily resolution is also applied, and missing values are interpolated through linear regression.

As a result of this process, the rainfall 3-month anomaly was removed from all country-specific datasets but Nigeria’s, the NDVI anomaly from Yemen’s and Syria’s, and the NDVI from the remaining four countries (see Supplementary Table S6), leaving rainfall, the 1-month rainfall anomaly and NDVI or its anomaly as the only remaining weather-related features for most countries, given the low level of correlation between them.

                              ], a widely used state-of-the-art machine learning technique known for its high performance and flexibility. XGBoost belongs to the category of so-called ensemble learning approaches, which is a branch of machine learning methods that makes use of several models at once to produce a single better output. In the case of XGBoost, the base model is a decision tree, which is considered best-in-class for handling small to medium-sized data. A decision tree is a set of hierarchical choices which eventually lead to a final result, i.e the prediction. Ensemble methods combine several decision trees to produce better predictive performance than utilizing a single decision tree. To create this collection of trees, XGBoost fits consecutive trees by, at every step, trying to solve for errors from the previous tree, using a gradient descent algorithm. The wider context of machine learning approaches used in the time series forecasting field and a more in-depth description of XGBoost can be found in Section 6 of the Supplementary Information.

                              The motivation behind the choice of this algorithm for this study is twofold. First, XGBoost can handle complex and non-linear relationships among the variables, which we expect to have in a complex phenomenon like food insecurity. Secondly, XGBoost has a high degree of flexibility, which makes it the most suitable candidate for a prediction task that is meant to eventually run as an operational tool in near real-time. Specifically, XGBoost can handle missing values in the input variables, which is a feature that makes it possible to automatically run the algorithm on a daily basis, even when a few values might be missing because, for example, of delays in data availability.

                              Since XGBoost does not support a multi-output design, we developed 30 different models, one for each prediction horizon. For each date, the prediction framework is trained to predict levels of insufficient food consumption for a given day into the future based on the information available up to the date under consideration. For further details, see Section 6 of the Supplementary Information.

                              In order to implement our forecasting model based on the usual three stages of training, validation and testing, we adopt a k-fold cross-validation approach in a time-ordered fashion (i.e. the evaluation stage is applied to different historical periods). The validation phase is implemented by splitting each of the n splits of training points of each sub-region into two time order preserving sets: the first 80% samples are used for training and the remaining ones for validation. Validation is performed independently across splits ensuring an unbiased approach. Our validation scheme aims to optimize the prediction framework by acting on two main configurations: model hyper-parameters and feature selection. The aim of this optimization is to find the configuration that returns the best performance as measured on a validation set. See Supplementary Table S8 for a detailed list of the explored hyper-parameters and values, and Supplementary Table S7 for the detailed list of independent variables and time lags considered. For further details, see Section 6 of the Supplementary Information.

                              Finally, in order to assess the goodness of the proposed forecasting model, its performance on the test sets is compared with a naive approach, where the predicted value at any given forecasting horizon is simply given by the last available value in the training and validation set, which represents the last available measured value before the start of the forecasting horizon.
