                             The rapid detection of outbreaks is a key step in the effective control and containment of infectious diseases. In particular, the identification of cases which might be epidemiologically linked is crucial in directing outbreak-containment efforts shaping the intervention of public health authorities. Often this requires the detection of clusters of cases whose numbers exceed those expected by a background of sporadic cases. Quantifying exceedances rapidly is particularly challenging when only few cases are typically reported in a precise location and time. To address such important public health concerns, we present a general method which can detect spatio-temporal deviations from a Poisson point process and estimate the odd of an isolate being part of a cluster. This method can be applied to diseases where detailed geographical information is available. In addition, we propose an approach to explicitly take account of delays in microbial typing. As a case study, we considered invasive group A Streptococcus infection events as recorded and typed by Public Health England from 2015 to 2020.

                             For decades, statistical principles and methods have been leveraged by public health officials to identify increases in diseases and raise early warnings where necessary. The effectiveness of these methods has been improved by the availability of large digital databases, which can store infection records and quickly be interrogated and processed [

                             Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a Gram-positive human pathogen that can colonise the throat and skin of humans. Asymptomatic throat carriage rates in the general population are reported to be around 7.5% in high-income countries [
                             <a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">

                             ]. Complex host-pathogen interactions in GAS infections can cause a broad range of symptom severity – from mild or asymptomatic infections to death. The most severe disease occurs when these bacteria invade parts of the body where they are usually not found (such as the blood, the muscles, or the lungs) and cause invasive infections, which requires hospitalisation and can lead to death [
                             <a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27">

                             ]. An important part of the epidemiological surveillance of invasive GAS (iGAS) infections is the typing of collected bacterial isolates. A widely used typing method for GAS is based on the sequence of the N-terminal part of the M-protein gene (emm), which is a highly polymorphic gene and allows us to distinguish strains of S. pyogenes which would otherwise look identical. So far, more than 200 emm types have been identified in Europe and North America, with few common types contributing to a high percentage of the total number of iGAS cases [
                             <a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28">

                             ]. In the UK, iGAS infections are notifiable and isolated from iGAS cases are sent to the national reference laboratory for emm typing, enabling the identification of cases which share the same emm gene and which could denote an outbreak. Non-invasive GAS isolates are rarely typed outside of an outbreak investigation. iGAS disease is of particular concern due to the recent upsurge in the number of cases in some countries [

                             To help identify clusters of iGAS which share the same emm type and are epidemiologically linked by geography and in time, we developed the random neighbourhood covering (RaNCover) approach. As an effective and automated algorithm, it would be complementary to what local health protection or public health teams can offer in the initial stages of outbreak detection, and may be of particular use with outbreaks which cross regional or team borders that might otherwise be difficult to detect. The general problem RaNCover addresses is to classify a single recorded infection as being part of a cluster or being consistent with a baseline of sporadic cases. To this end, we consider a neighbourhood of the point location and time of the recorded case and appropriately draw a random collection of spatio-temporal cylinders to cover it. Based on the properties of this collection of covering cylinders it is possible to perform classification. RaNCover is specifically tailored to diseases where detailed spatio-temporal information is available and aggregating data in coarse-grained bins (which results in less detailed information) is not desirable. As proof of concept, we deployed our framework on emm typed iGAS infections recorded in England.

                             The manuscript is organised as follows. In section Methods we introduce the outbreak-detection principles, define the RaNCover approach, illustrate it on simulated data, introduce the emm typed iGAS data, and derive the endemic baseline for this disease. The latter is used to generate synthetic data and perform additional simulation experiments for validation. In the section Results, RaNCover is retrospectively and prospectively applied to the iGAS data and the detected clusters are discussed with the help of a dimensionality reduction technique, which allows us to conveniently present the results. In the same section, we tackle emm typing delay. We conclude with a Discussion section.

The epidemic element can be thought of as realizations of processes with auto-regressive or self-exciting behavior, which arise from a common source, e.g., environmental exposure, increased susceptibility in the population, or invasion of a new pathogen. In other words, the presence of epidemic events is correlated with and reinforces the occurrence of successive events [

                              We argue that the most important characteristic common to all epidemic data is that observations are not independent. Therefore, to state whether cases are observed in atypical frequency, we must compare our observations with those expected if the cases were uncorrelated in both space and time. If the recorded case observations are consistent with such an uncorrelated baseline, no warning should be raised. This suggests that the first step of an outbreak detection system is to develop a naïve model for the observed cases — a null model — which does not consider any spatial or temporal correlations. The second step is then to detect (statistically significant) deviations of the observed pattern from that produced by the null model.

Throughout this manuscript, we stick to the standard false discovery rate α = 0.05for each single subset. It is worth noting that, by considering the state of multiple subsets, we increase robustness to random fluctuations and make highly unlikely to identify a cluster from random case data. In the null model, we indeed expect just 5% of independent subset to have a warning flag and even with just 20 subsets, the probability of generating a false flag is very small (probability of 19 out of 20 subsets having a flag is 3.6 × 10

                              for the first 9 time steps. To identify the events corresponding to the simulated outbreak in this point pattern we apply RaNCover as follows. We draw N= 10000 random covering cylinders of equal volume, with radia ρ ≅ (0.10,0.12,0.14,0.17,0.23) and height h = (1,2,3,4,5). The chosen volume is πρ

                              h ≅ 0.17, which corresponds to about 5expected baseline events per cylinder. The centre coordinates are randomly sampled with replacement from the episode locations and times, and randomly shifted whilst ensuring that each cylinder contains its assigned episode location. We then flag all the cylinders according to the basic exceedance criterion with α = 0.05. The classification performed by the algorithm is summarised by the warning scores, computed using this set of cylinders. These warning scores indeed appear to capture the synthetic outbreak, as illustrated in

                              In a more realistic surveillance scenario, the warning scores are prospectively updated as soon as new cases are detected and included into the dataset, which we take to occur at every point in time. Observing the individual warning scores varying as new observations are included allows us to assess timeliness. This measures the time elapsed between the case detection day and the day at which its warning score stabilises around its final value (corresponding to the retrospectively computed warning score). To simulate this, we iteratively apply the procedure detailed above to all the observations occurred until time τ, τ = 1,2, …, 20 and observe how the warning scores of cases detected previous to the update time τ vary with τ, while new cases are included and assessed.

For this simulation, the values of the warning scores appear to converge after only one or two updates, which suggests that the method can reach excellent timeliness.

Accordingly, we simulated the point process with intensity defined by equations (2) and (3) and parameters as estimated in section Methods, thus yielding a synthetic baseline of 4915 endemic cases (distributed over a period of 100 weeks in England) that should not raise any public-health concerns. The temporal intensity function of equation (6) fitted to all data in the study period is illustrated in

                              . We simulated an outbreak by including additional (epidemic) point events localised in 19 selected postcode areas (arbitrarily chosen around the town of St. Albans, north of Greater London) during a chosen time interval (weeks 40 to 59). In order to imitate the initial spread of infections and their subsequent control, the total number of epidemic events per week is initially low, increases and peaks around week 50, and finally decreases until the number of epidemic cases drops to zero (

                              ). Aggregating the cases over their geographic locations clearly shows the temporal trend as illustrated in

                              for both endemic and epidemic cases. Based on these time series, it is virtually impossible to detect excess cases during the outbreak. Analogously, aggregating over the time yields the geographical distributions of cases, which mainly occur alongside the most populated area (

                              ). Yet, whether a single case is part of the outbreak or not is clearly labelled in the synthetic dataset, thus making it ideal for evaluation purposes; this typically is not the case in real data.

                              Warning scores for all episodes of selected emm types are retrospectively generated following the procedure detailed in Methods, with N= 20,000 cylinders per emm type with respect to the baseline intensity of equation (5).

                              RaNCover consistently assigns high warning scores to neighbour cases and is thus able to reveal clusters which may belong to outbreaks. As each event is described by its spatial coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude) and its date, the neighbourhood must defined in both space and time. We use the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) method to plot these cases (identified by three dimensions, i.e., latitude, longitude, and detection time) in a two-dimensional space in a way that preserves neighbouring identities [
                              <a id="xref-ref-45-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-45">

                              ]. In other words, t-SNE is a general statistical-learning method for dimensionality reduction which here is used to pin a two-dimensional point for each point in the three-dimensional space, in such a way that nearby events in space and time appear next to each other in the two-dimensional map. Using a visualisation method based on neighbourhoods rather than on absolute distances is very useful in our context, where the local prevalence of each emm type is important. Indeed, for emm types with low prevalence, recorded episodes that are distant in space and time can be correctly identified as being part of the same outbreak. Conversely, common emm types already established in the host population may show more clusters in the same geographical area and time scale. We illustrate the results for 4 rare emm types (94.0, 108.1, 44.0, and 33.0), and a common emm type that did not appear to cluster (12.0).

                              It is possible to combine reporting delays in RaNCover. During the interval from the sampling to the emm typing date, we are aware that, at a precise location and time, a case of an emm type of concern might have occurred. Therefore, only incomplete information is available. Even so, it is desirable to account for this, since it may allow earlier outbreak detection. However, it is possible that an untyped case is not actually associated with the clusters of interest, thus including it into a surveillance system may substantially tamper the overall results. It is important to choose a suitable strategy, which we take to flag a subset if the untyped or typed observation exceeds their respective baselines. Prospectively, as the time progresses, new cases are observed and some previously observed cases are emm typed. In such a scenario, at a given point in time, in addition to the typed iGAS cases and their baselines (one for each emm type) one can collect the untyped cases and compute the corresponding baseline. As an example, the number of cases per week and the continuous baselines are plotted against time in

                              for the emm type 44.0 -- similar snapshots can be obtained for any other point in time. The number of untyped cases is highest in correspondence of the update week and quickly decays to zero as the observation week goes back in time. Using these two baselines and according to the procedure detailed in Methods, we computed the warning scores relative to a potential emm 44.0 outbreak of the untyped cases at each update week. More specifically, we are interested in the early warning scores of those cases which are later found to belong to the 2019 cluster. The early warning scores did not reach the threshold of 0.95, yet they are significantly larger than the baseline warning scores thus potentially providing early warning signals as illustrated in

                             In this paper, we have presented the random neighbourhood covering (RaNCover) approach, a statistical method that can identify outbreaks by detecting deviations from a baseline Poisson point process. It is based on a simple and scalable approach, i.e., measuring the expected and observed number of cases in random portions (viz., cylinders) of space and time. While the statistics in a single random region are not highly informative, aggregating information over many random regions permits the detection of infectious-disease clusters. A strength of this approach is that it returns a warning score for each recorded episode. This makes it ideal in application to diseases which are sparsely distributed, where it is appropriate to assess a new health event as soon as it is recorded, rather than waiting until enough cases are collected over a determined region or time interval.

                             Our method is akin to those based on the so-called scan statistics [

                             ]. They both rely on creating a large number of spatio-temporal sectors, each with a different set of detected cases in it. By means of the scan statistics one can identify the sectors with the highest likelihood ratio, which correspond to the regions where outbreaks are most likely to have occurred. Conversely, in RaNCover, drawing and inspecting many cylinders covering each event

                             . Compared to existing methods, it excels in execution speed and flexibility. One potential limitation of our approach is that the values of the warning scores depend on the chosen volumes of the spatio-temporal cylinders and are subject to fluctuations due to the random sampling of these sectors. In fact, extensive simulations show that, performing replicates with different sector sizes, the results remain consistent and fluctuations can be controlled by increasing the sampling.

                             RaNCover can be used for both retrospective and prospective analyses. Retrospective validation was performed on simulated data using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Deriving a binary warning from w requires choosing a cut off, which also governs sensitivity and specificity. For a given cut off, the sensitivity is defined here as the fraction of simulation-outbreak cases for which an alarm is generated, while the specificity is defined as the fraction of baseline cases that did not generate an alarm. The overall performance quantified by the ROC curve (obtained by plotting the sensitivity against the specificity at various cut-off settings) and the area under the curve (AUC or C-statistics) were excellent (ROC-AUCs >0.9 in all simulation scenarios). Fine tuning the cut off also serves as a way of reducing the number of false alarms or increasing the true positive rate, which can be useful in real-world surveillance settings.

                             As a proof-of-concept, we retrospectively detected a number of potential outbreaks of iGAS infections in England. For this disease, we estimated the baseline taking into account population denominator data and iGAS seasonality. In the absence of a definitive and comprehensive list of all real outbreaks that should be detected by public-health surveillance, it is hard to fully benchmark any surveillance method. In order to circumvent this latter point and confirm that our method consistently detects events in close proximity (both in space and time), we proposed to visualise the data using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) approach. The use of this dimensionality reduction algorithm on real iGAS data highlights events proximal in both space and time and confirms that detected cases with high warning scores typically cluster together.

                             The timeliness was prospectively assessed by tracking how the individual warning scores vary as new observations are included. It is worth noting that, in general, the timeliness can be influenced by the speed of the outbreak growth [

These can differ substantially between pathogens (which may require laboratory tests of different complexity) and between laboratories; some identifying some specimens may need several steps in succession; reporting delays may even vary over time, thus making relevant to address these with a general approach [

                             ]. It is desirable to leverage the information on an infection case potentially caused by the pathogen of interest, as this can anticipate the complete detection of a cluster upon emm typing. As an approach to this, we thus defined an early warning score based on exceedances in both typed and untyped records in the neighbourhoods of a case of interest. For cases that were later identified as part of a cluster, these early scores were indeed higher than those in the background, thus suggesting good predictive power.

                             Further work is planned to validate RaNCover in public health practice. This is based on the compilation of iGAS outbreak incidents identified through a variety of consensus sources, including whole-genome sequencing, contact tracing, and detailed public health investigation, which can ultimately confirm the presence of epidemiological links.

                             In conclusion, the RaNCover method is a convenient clustering tool for the spatio-temporal surveillance of communicable diseases such as iGAS infections, which typically are sparsely distributed over a geographical area and yet pose major threats to people’s health due to their severity. For these diseases, traditional surveillance methods typically require aggregating data over time and space. Consequently, they cannot fully leverage all the detailed geographical information that is available. Similarly to SaTScan

                             , our method can be used at arbitrary levels of geographical and temporal aggregation. RaNCover further provides a continuous warning score for each detected case, rather than for coarse-grained time windows or geographical regions, and yet remains able to highlight emerging clusters of diseases. The method only requires deriving a null model for the baseline and can be used for different types of diseases, regardless of the complexity of their host-pathogen dynamics.
