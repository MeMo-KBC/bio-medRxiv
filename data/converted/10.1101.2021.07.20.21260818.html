  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Infant mortality remains high and unevenly distributed in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Though cheap and effective interventions can in principle prevent many of these deaths, given a finite budget for supplying such interventions in many countries, their life-saving benefit is critically constrained by the ability to target them to those individuals who would have otherwise have likely died. While countries routinely use poverty- or wealth-based thresholds to target policies and interventions including those related to maternal health and early mortality, we examine whether models that consider other easy-to-measure and factors can substantially improve our ability to identify higher-risk births, and consequently the potential for life-saving intervention.

Methods Using up to 25 variables from the demographic health survey for 22 sub-Saharan African countries, we employ established machine learning methods to estimate per-child risk of infant mortality, separately in each country. We use out-of-sample testing methods to provide an honest assessment of how useful these methods are for identifying high risk births. We also compare this to a benchmark similar to standard practice, in which only (within-country) measures of wealth can be used for targeting.

Results Targeting based on wealth alone is only slightly better than random targeting: the poorest 10 percent of the population experiencing approximately 10 percent of total infant mortality burden. By contrast the 10 percent of the population at highest risk according to our model account for 15-30 percent of infants deaths, depending on country. In other words, for a hypothetical intervention with some fixed effectiveness and that can be administered to only a chosen 10 percent of the population, such a targeting approach would save 1.5-3 times as many lives as one based on wealth alone.

Interpretation In the 22 sub-Saharan African countries studied, approaches that use commonly available types of data to flexibly predict high-risk births has the potential to substantially improve the targeting and thus maximum potential effectiveness of life-saving interventions against early mortality.

Evidence before the study In many low-income countries, interventions that aim to reduce infant mortality cannot be made universally available. While low-cost medical interventions are available to avoid many of the most common causes of death, these interventions can only save lives if they are targeted to individuals who would have otherwise died. Currently, most national programs and policies aiming to reduce infant mortality employ only poverty-related assessments to target those programs. Large gains in the effective targeting of such programs, and thus their life-saving potential, may be possible if risk can be assessed using more flexible statistical models that draw on a variety of easy-to-collect data, but existing models have not. Surprisingly, few prior studies have combined multiple risk factors to estimate early-life mortality risk in the general population. [1][1],[2][2],[3][3] None of these employ flexible (machine learning) models, or compare the results to a traditional poverty-or wealth-based targeting benchmark.

Added value of this study Working with publicly available data from 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we first show that targeting early mortality interventions based only on income assessments cannot do much better than random distribution in most countries. We then employ established machine learning methods to show how using a range of generally available data prior to each birth, a risk score can be computed for each birth that is more predictive of early mortality. Targeting the highest risk decile of births, for example, can capture only about 10% of deaths using income alone, but 15-30% (depending on the country) with our more inclusive model.

Implications of all available evidence We conclude that it is feasible, using standard machine learning methods and data similarly to what is routinely collected, to greatly improve upon income-based targeting schemes for interventions seeking to minimize early mortality. In the cases studied, these could greatly improve the targeting and consequently the life-saving potential of these interventions.

                               Background
                              </strong>
                              Infant mortality remains high and unevenly distributed in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Though cheap and effective interventions can in principle prevent many of these deaths, given a finite budget for supplying such interventions in many countries, their life-saving benefit is critically constrained by the ability to target them to those individuals who would have otherwise have likely died. While countries routinely use poverty- or wealth-based thresholds to target policies and interventions including those related to maternal health and early mortality, we examine whether models that consider other easy-to-measure and factors can substantially improve our ability to identify higher-risk births, and consequently the potential for life-saving intervention.

                              </strong>
                              Using up to 25 variables from the demographic health survey for 22 sub-Saharan African countries, we employ established machine learning methods to estimate per-child risk of infant mortality, separately in each country. We use out-of-sample testing methods to provide an honest assessment of how useful these methods are for identifying high risk births. We also compare this to a benchmark similar to standard practice, in which only (within-country) measures of wealth can be used for targeting.

                              Targeting based on wealth alone is only slightly better than random targeting: the poorest 10 percent of the population experiencing approximately 10 percent of total infant mortality burden. By contrast the 10 percent of the population at highest risk according to our model account for 15-30 percent of infants deaths, depending on country. In other words, for a hypothetical intervention with some fixed effectiveness and that can be administered to only a chosen 10 percent of the population, such a targeting approach would save 1.5-3 times as many lives as one based on wealth alone.

                              In the 22 sub-Saharan African countries studied, approaches that use commonly available types of data to flexibly predict high-risk births has the potential to substantially improve the targeting and thus maximum potential effectiveness of life-saving interventions against early mortality.

                               In many low-income countries, interventions that aim to reduce infant mortality cannot be made universally available. While low-cost medical interventions are available to avoid many of the most common causes of death, these interventions can only save lives if they are targeted to individuals who would have otherwise died. Currently, most national programs and policies aiming to reduce infant mortality employ only poverty-related assessments to target those programs. Large gains in the effective targeting of such programs, and thus their life-saving potential, may be possible if risk can be assessed using more flexible statistical models that draw on a variety of easy-to-collect data, but existing models have not. Surprisingly, few prior studies have combined multiple risk factors to estimate early-life mortality risk in the general population.

                               Working with publicly available data from 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we first show that targeting early mortality interventions based only on income assessments cannot do much better than random distribution in most countries. We then employ established machine learning methods to show how using a range of generally available data prior to each birth, a risk score can be computed for each birth that is more predictive of early mortality. Targeting the highest risk decile of births, for example, can capture only about 10% of deaths using income alone, but 15-30% (depending on the country) with our more inclusive model.

                             A major limitation, however, is that most countries with high early mortality cannot provide such interventions universally, so must choose how they should be targeted. The accuracy of this targeting severely limits the life-saving potential of an intervention, because an intervention given to a child who would have survived without that intervention has no effect on mortality. An infant mortality rate of 80 deaths per 1,000 births for example is far too high, yet this rate of 0.8% means that intervention given to a random set of individuals can save at most 0.8% of those to whom it is given. More realistically, such an intervention will only have some efficacy rate among those who would have otherwise have died, say, 10%.

                             An intervention given at random could then save the lives of only 0.8% * 10% = 0.08% of those to whom it is given. By contrast, if such an intervention could instead be targeted to a group with a higher risk of mortality, say 10%, then with the same efficacy rate it would save the lives of 10% * 10% = 1% of recipients, saving 12.5 times as many lives. In this way, the lives saved by a (hypothetical) intervention with a given efficacy rate is limited by, and proportional to, the ability to target those at risk. Efforts to improve targeting should thus be treated with as much importance and urgency as efforts to improve the efficacy of the available intervention.

                             Unfortunately, this has not been the case. Although early mortality can have many causes and can be related to many risk factors, most countries facing high early mortality target policies and interventions based on one or a few risk factors, almost invariably indicators for low income or wealth, or a related conception of poverty. But research into models for early mortality that look beyond income, poverty, or wealth remain rare, and not designed to demonstrate how practical, national level systems could target interventions to high-risk births.

                             finds, first, that in Brazil and India, poverty is a poor proxy for risk of early mortality, much as we find below for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Further, for births in India, they find that using just four risk factors in a linear model roughly doubles the fraction of infant deaths that can be identified in the highest risk quintile as compared to models relying on a proxy for poverty. Our work builds on this by examining the degree to which flexibly-estimated, individual-level risk scores based only on a range of generally available, pre-birth data can improve the targeting of life-saving interventions against infant mortality. Specifically, we estimate mortality risk in individual infants (under one year of age) in 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We employ flexible (machine learning) models able to identify predictive relationships that may have eluded more rigid regression models, particularly as we provide these models with access to a wider range of risk factors than previous work. We also take care to employ only risk factors that can generally be known or anticipated prior to a child’s birth, as practical targeting systems may be limited to such data. As is standard in many machine learning applications, we employ cross-validation to protect against over-fitting overly optimistic performance claims. However, breaking with convention, we rely on mathematically simple, easy-to-understand performance metrics that directly relate to the potential impact of a hypothetical policy intervention.

                             To understand how this compares to the status quo, we benchmark our models against a wealth-based model. This is an imperfect proxy for the policies that in fact use poverty-line determinations to target (bundled) programs, as poverty assessment may be in part or whole based on income rather than wealth. That said, at least some programs that target poor household use data sources to determine poverty status very similar to ours.

While this restricts our attention to children under the age of five, this module contains more predictive variables than the “all births” module. More importantly, it would be inadvisable to use data collected on the mother, household, malaria prevalence, location, etc. in the year of the DHS data collection to predict early mortality from a birth many years before.

                              For predictors or risk factors (we use the terms interchangeably) we limit ourselves to predictors that (i) would be reasonably available to policymakers and health workers in-country, and (ii) are measurable prior to the birth of the child, rather than depending on the health or other features of the child once borne. The latter constraint is in place so that these risk factors could be used to calculate risk in advance and deploy interventions to households, clinics, or regions with high risk.

                              The resulting risk factors we consider are: maternal age, malaria prevalence in the vicinity, head of household age and sex, parental education, cooking fuel type, floor type, toilet type, drinking water type, income, birth order, birth month, religion, bed net usage, age at first marriage or union, and the death of a previous child under one or five years of age (see Table S3 in the online supplement). Geographic information is also used, but varies in its granularity by country. We recode variables with many categories to construct measures that are likely to perform better. For example, the DHS data initially contain 66 categories of toilet types, which we simplified to 4 categories based on the level of improvement.

Note that, because the machine learning methods we apply can tolerate a large number of variables and choose which to ultimately included “on their own”, we do not perform a separate model selection procedure to narrow this set of variables.

                              Finally, the IPUMS DHS data do not contain an indication of how an individual or household is classified relative to the poverty line in a given country, nor does it attempt to measure income as such. Thus, rather than including any locally-defined poverty measure, we employ the wealth-based indices provided by DHS. This measure is an imputed index for within-country wealth, imputed by DHS using principal components analysis over a number of variables including ownership of radios, televisions, and other domestic equipment; electricity and clean water; type of materials used in the walls, floor and roof; and the type of toilet in the household. Scores are calculated at the household level. The only requirement we make of this measure is that, within a given country, it provides an imperfect but potentially informative measure of relative wealth. Since this index is constructed within each country, and we train each country’s risk model separately, there is no expectation nor need for cross-country comparability on this index.

                              We estimate infant mortality risk for each birth in the data set. In each country, we separately run two sets of models. One is a “wealth model”, described below as a proxy for what can be achieved through poverty-based targeting. The other set contains flexible machine learning approaches that use the predictors described above to estimate individual level mortality risk. These include random forest (rf), extreme gradient boosting over trees (xgb), kernel regularized least squares (krls), and elastic-net regularized logistic regression (elastic-logit).

While such single-tree models are easy to interpret, they often perform poorly, and small changes in the input data can have dramatic effects on the model and results. The rf and xgb methods improve on single-tree approaches by combining many trees. For rf, this is achieved by effectively averaging together the estimates of many trees, each employing only a random subset of the input variables and trained on a random subset of the observations. As applied here, each forest contains 500 trees, and the number of variables randomly sampled for each tree split (

Under xgb, this is similarly achieved by combining many trees, but by beginning with one tree, adding the predictions of another tree trained on the errors of the prior, then repeating this process hundreds or thousands of times. We use cross-validation for each country to determine (i) the learning rate (η ∈ (0, 1), where smaller values help to prevent overfitting), (ii) the maximum depth of the trees (

Such approaches effectively build a model by leveraging information about how similar observations are to each other. Each observation is treated as a potential “fence post” in the data, and the model learns how being closer to or further from each such location in the data influences the expected probability of mortality. We employ a Gaussian kernel as the measure of similarity using default values.

                              Finally, we construct a simple ensemble model in which each predicted probability is the unweighted average of the probabilities produced by elastic-logit, rf, xgb, and krls. This has two primary benefits. The first is that such ensembles often have performance as good as the best sub-models and sometimes better. Second, it allows us to commit to reporting results for a single model—the ensemble model—as our premier estimate of the predictive power of these model on the test data. This is preferable to reporting the best-performing model on the test set, which can be misleading because such a choice is effectively a means of “training on the test set”.

                              Our wealth-based model employs wealth information flexibly: mortality is regressed on ten indicators for decile of wealth, equivalent to finding the mean mortality level in each wealth decide. In evaluating model performance, we can consider how being in the highest risk decile, quartile, or other groups is related to mortality risk. There is no presumption that risk is necessarily decreasing or even monotonic in the level of wealth.

                              We note that this is a wealth model, not a poverty model based on poverty assessments made by countries, usually based on income. Neither income nor poverty-assessments themselves are available in the DHS data. This limits our ability to benchmark against a true poverty-based system. That said, our wealth model may reasonably provide an optimistic indication of what can be predicted by income or poverty-based approaches. Household income is time-sensitive, but is likely to generate risks of early mortality when it remains low on average over a long period of time, in which case wealth will also drop.

Our wealth model is also more flexible and less coarse than poverty-based targeting systems, which typically assign individuals through a binary system (e.g. above or below the poverty line). Again this is intended to be a favorable choice for the wealth model, so that we can later consider its demonstrated performance likely to be over-rather than under-stated.

                              Before fitting any model, we split the data into training and test sets. For each country, 80% of observations are placed in a training and validation set, while 20% are retained in a held-out testing set. For the models described above, we tune hyperparameters using either 10-fold cross-validation within the training set (for elastic-logit, rf, xgb) or leave-one-out cross-validation (for krls). The cross-validation procedure also gives a preliminary assessment of model performance. Once all modeling choices were finalized based on this cross-validation, those models were “frozen” and we then assessed performance on the test set. This was done only once, after writing the a draft of the paper using the cross-validation results, then updating the final values using the actual test-set results. This provides an honest out-of-sample performance assessment, prohibiting any “training on the test set”. We report the accuracy of the models using the performance metrics described below.

                              Our models only seek to determine the best risk estimate possible given a set of predictors and the answers say nothing of the causal effect of those predictors on the risk of mortality. Indeed, many of the risk factors, such as religion or the type of roof, are valuable not because they cause mortality but because they are expected to signal the presence of other, unobserved factors that cause higher mortality. In other words, confounding is expected and hoped for in these models.

                              It is valuable nevertheless to understand which variables the models deem most important in estimating the risk, for the purposes of assessing the credibility of the model, improving future models, or focusing public health resources on data collection. Unfortunately, for many machine learning models it is more difficult to characterize the model’s behavior than is the case with simpler regression approaches like OLS or logit, in which the model is fully characterized by a small number of parameters. That said, readily available measures of variable importance for different models can provide some useful insights. Specifically, for elastic-net we report how often the model chose a given variable and the proportion of time their coefficient is positive. For random forest, the (scaled) “variable importance” describes what fraction of the time a given variable was chosen to be included in the classification trees over which each random forest model aggregates.

                              Finally, to evaluate our approach, we employ simple, policy-relevant metrics rather than more esoteric and difficult to interpret metrics often relied upon in machine learning tasks. A model’s recall (also referred to as sensitivity) is the proportion of actual deaths that are included in the group we consider to be at risk. What we term “recall10” is defined by first determining the group of births in the top risk decile (hence the “10”) according to our model, then computing the fraction of all actual infant deaths accounted for by this group. In policy terms, this corresponds to a case in which we have resources to target 10% of the population, and wish to know how much of the total mortality risk would be covered in that group. An ineffective risk assessment that assigns risk at random would produce a recall10 of 0.10 (10%). By contrast an effective system points us to a top risk decile that accounts for more than 10% of the mortality, such as 20% or 30%. Similarly, we report recall20, which tells us the fraction of early deaths that occurred within the top risk quintile. For both recall10 and recall20, we also report “efficiency gain”, which tells us how many times more effective the ensemble model is than the benchmark wealth model.

                              provides the primary results, showing the proportion of mortality that occurred among the top 10% highest predicted risk individuals in the test set. In Rwanda and Uganda, wealth is a reasonable indicator of risk, and the 10% of the population with the higher wealth-based predicted risk account for 24% and 18% of the mortality, respectively. In the other 20 countries, wealth is almost uninformative, with recall10 values falling between just 3% (Tanzania) and 14% (Lesotho). Overall, the (country-wise) average recall10 of just 11% suggests that the wealth generally model does little or no better than chance in predicting which individuals are at highest risk. Similarly,

Overall these models perform similarly to each other, and far better than the wealth-only model. The top risk deciles according to these models account for, on average, 17-20% of mortality (recall10); the top risk quintile accounts for 30-32% of mortality (recall20). The ensemble model performs better than any of the individual models, on average capturing 22% of the mortality in its top risk decile (recall10), and 35% in the top risk quintile (recall20). Compared to the wealth model, the ensemble model also captures 2.3 times as much of the mortality in its top risk decile (efficiency gain for recall10) and 1.6 times the mortality in its top risk quintile (efficiency gain for recall20). No single country always shows the highest recall10 across models, nor the lowest. Moreover, within given countries, the ensemble model outperforms the constituent models in many cases, does as well as the top one or two models in many others, and is never the worst performing model in that country. Thus, relying on the ensemble model not only yields better results than any other model on average, but also safeguards against cases where individual models perform poorly in a given country.

                               The elastic-net logistic regression model for each country automatically chooses a subset of variables to retain in the model. Surprisingly, every variable was included in at least 23% of the country-level models. A few variables, though, are included especially often: most models included the previous death of a sibling in the first year (86%) or the death of any previous sibling at any point (76%). 77% of country level models included the child’s gender; 73% included an urban/rural indicator. Over two-thirds (68%) of models included the mother’s years of education, and many included the birth month (73% use sine-transformed birth month; 55% use cosine-transformed birth month). Maternal age was included in 64% of models.

                               For random forest, the “scaled variable importance” describes what fraction of the time a given variable was chosen to be included in the classification trees over which each random forest model aggregates. Compared to elastic-net logistic regression, random forest was somewhat more selective, with over half of variables appearing in fewer than 15% of the regression trees. A few variables were rarely included, such as clean cooking fuel (3%) and minority religion (5%). By contrast, maternal age was included nearly every time (99.6%), followed closely by wealth percentile and it’s square (93%, 94%). The latter set is particularly notable, as wealth percentiles were among the least commonly employed in the elastic-net logit models. Other important variables included malaria incidence rate in the area (92%), age of household head (77%), and mother’s age at first marriage or union (63%).

                             Across 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, predicting early mortality based on wealth measures alone was ineffective: those in highest 10% and 20% risk groups accounted for only 11% and 23% of mortality respectively. Fortunately, when wealth information is combined with other risk factors, flexible models can more accurately assess individual-level risk of early mortality. On average across countries, the 10% of births with the highest risk as predicted by the ensemble model account for 22% of deaths, and the 20% at highest risk account for 35%. Compared to the wealth-only models—which we expect are optimistic benchmarks for the poverty-based targeting approach—each country’s ensemble model on average would have identified 2.3 times as many deaths in the top risk decile, and 1.6 times as many in the top 20% risk group. Senegal offers a relatively representative example, in which targeting the poorest 10% will identify only 10% of all infant deaths, while targeting the 10% at highest risk according to the ensemble model would identify 29% of all deaths.

                             The various models used to incorporate these risk factors—a regularized logistic regression (elastic-logit), random forest (rf), extreme gradient boosting (xgb), and kernel regularized least squares (krls)—have similar average performance. However, some models exceed others in particular countries. Using the average of predictions from these (ensemble) generates better performance on average while importantly protecting against cases where individual models performed poorly in particular countries. Particularly important to many models were variables regarding the previous death of siblings in the first year, mother’s age and education, malaria prevalence, and the child’s gender. The value of these variables as predictors says nothing of their causal influence or importance. Rather, they are likely to be predictive not because they cause or prevent mortality, but because they signal the presence or absence of other important unmeasured factors that do.

                             Central to the policy-relevance of such an approach is the question of whether the variables needed to run these models are generally accessible. The risk factors we included were all chosen to be feasibly collected and employed in targeting strategies by health agencies. We avoided post-birth variables, such as birth-weight, which require real-time data. Only the sex of the child and the calendar month of birth are unknown until the birth occurs, and this would not impede the planning or siting of interventions and materials that are expected to reduce preventable deaths.

                             These findings are consistent with previous studies that show that births at high risk of death exist across all socioeconomic groups, and that for various purposes combined multiple risk factors and show that doing so improves our ability to identify the higher risk births.

                             Another way to characterize these results is to construct a hypothetical scenario involving an intervention with some fixed efficacy rate and fixed budget, then examine how targeting with this system would compare to another in terms of the hypothetical lives saved. For example, consider an intervention that a given country can afford to administer to only 10% of births. Ideally, this would be targeted to the 10% at highest risk of early mortality. This intervention would not reduce mortality among children who would not have died anyway, but let us suppose it has a fixed efficacy rate, which as defined above, is the probability of saving a life that would have otherwise have been lost. In a country with N
                             <sub>
                              births
                             </sub>
                             births per year, the number of lives saved per year would be efficacy * Pr(death|high risk) * N
                             <sub>
                              births

                             /10. Applying Bayes’ rule, this is equal to efficacy * recall10 * Pr(death) * N
                             <sub>
                              births

                             where Pr(death) is the overall mortality rate expected for children born in that year (absent the intervention). Notice that the number of lives saved is proportional to the recall10 of the model used, which is why we chose this measure as a simple and policy relevant metric of performance, as opposed to other measures used for classification accuracy in machine learning such various “f-scores” or or the “area under the curve” on a receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).

                             the number of lives saved by an intervention with an efficacy of 5% would be 841 thousand for the wealth model, but 1.61 million for the ensemble model. In simpler terms, the efficiency gain of roughly two for these models compared to the wealth model translates into roughly twice as many lives saved by an intervention with any particular efficacy.

                             Again, we consider this a charactierization of the model performance through a hypothetical illustration, not an extrapolation intended to predict lives saved, since assumptions such as constant cost regardless of the targeting strategy or constant efficacy rate could reasonably be incorrect.

If such models are to be used in practice, they would be retrained on the available data in a given country at present with careful tuning by cross-validation to avoid over-fitting.

                              Our work is not without limitations. First, while our aim was to rely only on the types of predictors that are already widely available through existing IPUMS DHS data, unfortunately a few countries did not have surveys even in recent decades (Sudan) or lacked important basic variable such as district-level or lower geographic information and malaria prevalence (Burundi, Chad, Ethiopia, Liberia, Namibia). This limits generalization of our findings to areas with the lowest data availability, but also points to the need to identify or build suitable data sources for these countries.

                              Second, the DHS sampling procedure attempts to produce a sample that is representative of the population. If these are in fact not as representative as hoped, then while the results still reflect the predictive power of these models in some population of each country, the results may not be representative of these countries as a whole.

                              Finally, and most broadly, the central limitation is simply that not all deaths can be predicted, at least with the data we considered to be readily available in most countries. In general we find our models for the highest 10% risk group capture only 20-30% of mortality. This is beneficial and worth using for targeting since the effectiveness of an intervention is proportional to this recall rate, as shown above. However, it leaves a great deal of unpredicted mortality spread across the lower risk groups. Thus, when possible, programs must still be targeted to a much wider group in order to capture a large fraction of births that will die. Relatedly, in the future and with appropriate data, approaches like ours could be refined if information of the cause of death were available. Associating each birth to a particular cause of the death could generate models that suggest not only which births to target, but also which intervention(s) to make available to them.

Similarly, studying under-5 mortality also requires limiting ourselves to older data that are less relevant to the present or to future years in which these models would be applied.
