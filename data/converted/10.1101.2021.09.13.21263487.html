  <meta name="DC.Description" content="We investigated anti-spike IgG antibody responses and correlates of protection following second doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the UK general population. In 222,493 individuals, we found significant boosting of anti-spike IgG by second doses of both vaccines in all ages and using different dosing intervals, including the 3-week interval for BNT162b2. After second vaccination, BNT162b2 generated higher peak levels than ChAdOX1. Older individuals and males had lower peak levels with BNT162b2 but not ChAdOx1, while declines were similar across ages and sexes with ChAdOX1 or BNT162b2. Prior infection significantly increased antibody peak level and half-life with both vaccines. Anti-spike IgG levels were associated with protection from infection after vaccination and, to an even greater degree, after prior infection. At least 67% protection against infection was estimated to last for 2-3 months after two ChAdOx1 doses and 5-8 months after two BNT162b2 doses in those without prior infection, and 1-2 years for those unvaccinated after natural infection. A third booster dose may be needed, prioritised to ChAdOx1 recipients and those more clinically vulnerable.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="We investigated anti-spike IgG antibody responses and correlates of protection following second doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the UK general population. In 222,493 individuals, we found significant boosting of anti-spike IgG by second doses of both vaccines in all ages and using different dosing intervals, including the 3-week interval for BNT162b2. After second vaccination, BNT162b2 generated higher peak levels than ChAdOX1. Older individuals and males had lower peak levels with BNT162b2 but not ChAdOx1, while declines were similar across ages and sexes with ChAdOX1 or BNT162b2. Prior infection significantly increased antibody peak level and half-life with both vaccines. Anti-spike IgG levels were associated with protection from infection after vaccination and, to an even greater degree, after prior infection. At least 67% protection against infection was estimated to last for 2-3 months after two ChAdOx1 doses and 5-8 months after two BNT162b2 doses in those without prior infection, and 1-2 years for those unvaccinated after natural infection. A third booster dose may be needed, prioritised to ChAdOx1 recipients and those more clinically vulnerable.

                             We investigated anti-spike IgG antibody responses and correlates of protection following second doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the UK general population. In 222,493 individuals, we found significant boosting of anti-spike IgG by second doses of both vaccines in all ages and using different dosing intervals, including the 3-week interval for BNT162b2. After second vaccination, BNT162b2 generated higher peak levels than ChAdOX1. Older individuals and males had lower peak levels with BNT162b2 but not ChAdOx1, while declines were similar across ages and sexes with ChAdOX1 or BNT162b2. Prior infection significantly increased antibody peak level and half-life with both vaccines. Anti-spike IgG levels were associated with protection from infection after vaccination and, to an even greater degree, after prior infection. At least 67% protection against infection was estimated to last for 2-3 months after two ChAdOx1 doses and 5-8 months after two BNT162b2 doses in those without prior infection, and 1-2 years for those unvaccinated after natural infection. A third booster dose may be needed, prioritised to ChAdOx1 recipients and those more clinically vulnerable.

The largest effects were associated with prior infection, peak 219 BAU/mL higher (210-227) and ethnicity, peak 41 BAU/mL (36-47) higher in those reporting non-white ethnicity. Peak levels were slightly lower in males, those reporting a long-term health condition, those not working in healthcare, with shorter dosing intervals, younger age, and less deprivation (higher deprivation percentile). Prior infection extended the half-life by 13 days (95%Crl 9-17). There were very small reductions in half-life at older ages, with non-white ethnicity, and having a long-term health condition. There was no evidence of associations between half-life and sex, being a healthcare worker, and dosing interval in participants who received ChAdOx1.

Participants tested PCR-positive at 202 (1.6%), 1327 (0.6%), and 591 (0.5%) visits, respectively. Vaccinated participants with evidence of prior infection were excluded, as there were insufficient data to model these groups separately, and associations may differ. Adjustment was made for confounders, including age, geography, and calendar time (see Methods).

                              Compared with unvaccinated individuals with a most recent anti-spike IgG measurement of 1 BAU/mL, protection against infection increased steeply as antibody levels rose in unvaccinated participants, consistent with protection from prior infection, with 50% protection at 20 BAU/mL (below the 23 BAU/mL positivity threshold) and 67% protection at 33 BAU/mL. Higher antibody levels were needed to achieve the same level of protection post vaccination, with no evidence of differences in protection between ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 at any given antibody level (

For example, considering antibody levels where two thirds (67%) of individuals were protected against infection, participants vaccinated with ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 required estimated levels of 107 BAU/mL and 94 BAU/mL (100 BAU/mL in models pooling both vaccines), respectively. However, as described above, antibody levels rose to higher levels following BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1, explaining higher vaccine effectiveness after BNT162b vs. ChAdOx1

                             Based on a large random sample of the UK population, we found significant boosting of anti-spike IgG following second doses of both ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines in all age groups and using different dosing intervals, including the three-week dosing interval for BNT162b2.

After the second vaccination, older age, male sex, and long-term health conditions were all associated with substantially lower peak levels in participants who received BNT162b2 but had smaller effects on peak levels with ChAdOx1. Participants with prior infection had significantly higher peak levels for both vaccines, and their antibody levels fell more slowly. Based on our estimates of anti-spike antibody levels as correlates of protection, antibody levels associated with 67% protection against infection with Delta last for 2-3 months following a second dose of ChAdOx1 and 5-8 months after BNT162b2 in those without prior infection, and could last for 1-2 years in those unvaccinated, but seroconverting following natural infection.

However, non-response to a second dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 was much smaller, <1%, suggesting that second doses can significantly boost an initial suboptimal response in most individuals.

                             Antibody trajectories after vaccination differed substantially by prior infection status. From the Bayesian linear mixed model, prior infection was associated with a significantly higher peak level and a longer half-life for both ChAdOX1 and BNT162b2. Our results are consistent with recent studies in healthcare workers showing that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to higher antibody levels and slower waning post second BNT162b2 vaccination

From the generalised additive models, we found slightly lower IgG levels after a single BNT162b2 dose in previously infected participants vs. those with two BNT162b2 doses without prior infection, particularly at older ages. This suggests that a second BNT162b2 dose may still be helpful for previously infected individuals where supplies are sufficient, especially for older age groups.

Consistent with this, the 3-week dosing interval for BNT162b resulted in a lower peak level compared to an 8-week interval. Other studies also reported lower antibody levels at 2-3 weeks

However, correlating time-updated antibody measurements to protection from infection is important to inform the timing of boosters and other control measures, but existing studies combining correlates of protection and longitudinal data from the same assay are limited. We found higher anti-spike IgG levels were associated with increased protection from infection, but that the level of protection associated with a given antibody level depended on the mechanism generating the antibodies, with natural infection resulting in lower measured antibody levels, but greater protection at a given antibody level, compared to vaccination. We did not see evidence of vaccine-specific differences, with the greater protection from BNT162b vs. ChAdOx1 explained by higher antibody levels rather than increased protection at a given antibody level. Using 67% protection against infection as an example threshold, protection was relatively short-lived in those not previously infected and receiving ChAdOx1; mean levels fell below this threshold at 50-90 days post second dose, but protection was more prolonged following two doses of BNT162b, 160-230 days. In those without prior infection, 6 months after the second dose, only 10% of those with ChAdOx1 would maintain 67% protection, while 40-80% those with BNT162b2 would still be above the threshold, indicating that a booster dose may be prioritised to those who had two doses of ChAdOx1, and would need to be individualised to optimise protection after two BNT162b2 doses. However, 9 months after the second dose of either vaccine, almost everyone without prior infection was below the threshold level associated with 67% protection. Our results are consistent with several recent studies reporting waning vaccine effectiveness 3-6 months after second BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccinations

                             Limitations include the fact that we assumed that associations between protection and antibody levels were constant over time, in order to predict vaccine effectiveness from antibody levels beyond the study follow-up. Even though antibody levels decrease over time, other vaccine-induced immune mechanisms, including memory responses, may theoretically provide greater protection at lower antibody levels. There may also be differences in antibody levels and classes in peripheral blood compared to potential exposure sites such as the respiratory tract. Hence, our estimated duration of protection could potentially be underestimated if other immune responses confer longer protection.

                             In summary, the second ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 dose significantly boosts anti-spike IgG levels, and dosing interval has a limited impact on antibody response. Peak levels were higher after BNT162b than ChAdOx1, but older individuals, males, and those with long-term health conditions have lower antibody levels with BNT162b2. Protection based on the threshold level associated with 67% protection can last for 2-3 months for ChAdOx1 and 5-8 months for BNT162b2 in those without prior infection, and can be 1-2 years for those unvaccinated who seroconvert after natural infection. Those vaccinated with prior infection could be protected for >1 year. These results may inform vaccination strategies; a third boosting dose should be prioritised to ChAdOx1 recipients, groups with faster antibody declines, and more clinically vulnerable individuals.

We built separate models by vaccine type and prior infection status given the hypothesis that antibody response would vary by these two factors. Each model was minimally adjusted for only age and dosing interval using a tensor product of B-splines to allow for non-linearity and interaction among age, dosing interval, and time since vaccination, setting the date of the second vaccination as t=0.

We found that the spline model had a higher LOOIC (indicating a worse model fit) than the log-linear model for ChAdOx1 (382954 vs 378640) and BNT162b2 (252730 vs 240472). For both vaccines, the estimated trajectories were similar and there was no evidence of antibody decline flattening (

The outcome was right-censored at 450 BAU/mL reflecting truncation of IgG values at the upper limit of quantification (i.e. all measurements truncated to 450 BAU/mL were considered to be >450 BAU/mL in analyses). We built a multivariable model to examine the association between peak levels and antibody half-lives with continuous age (16-85 years), sex, ethnicity, report having a long-term health condition, report working in patient-facing healthcare, deprivation percentile, continuous dosing interval (7-13 weeks), and prior infection status for both vaccines. For BNT162b2, we additionally examined the impact of a 3-week dosing interval (17-28 days) by creating a binary variable and excluding antibody measurements ≤42 days post-second dose for the 3-week group (identified from the GAM as they peaked at around 42 days post-second dose).

Analyses were based on visits, dropping any visits where participants were not at risk due to a recent new positive PCR test, with new PCR-positive episodes as the outcome. We used separate logistic generalised additive models for three outcomes: any positive PCR episode, a positive PCR episode with a moderate to high viral load (Ct value <30), a positive PCR episode with self-reported symptoms. Two exposure specifications were investigated. Firstly, considering the effect of the most recent antibody measurement obtained 21-59 days prior to the current visit, excluding more recent measurements to avoid changes in antibody levels arising from recent infection that might only be detected at the routine study visit despite occurring before this. Alternatively, we considered the maximum antibody measurement obtained ≥21 days prior to the visit. The relationship between antibody levels and the outcome was modelled using thin plate splines. We adjusted for the following confounders in all models: geographic area (12 regions in England, or Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland) and age in years, rural-urban home address, sex, ethnicity (white vs. non-white), household size, multigenerational household, deprivation, presence of long-term health conditions, working in a care-home, having a patient-facing role in health or social care, direct or indirect contact with a hospital or care-home, smoking status, and visit frequency. Calendar time and age were included using a tensor spline which was allowed to vary by region/country

Vaccinated participants with evidence of prior infection were excluded, as there were insufficient data to model these groups separately and the relationship between antibody levels and protection may differ in these groups.
