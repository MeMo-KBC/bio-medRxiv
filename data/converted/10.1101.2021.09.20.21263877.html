  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Aims Determine factors affecting first return to work (RTW) status and time in patients treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (aRCR) under state-based compensation schemes in New South Wales, Australia, compared to those outside such schemes.

Material and Methods Patients undergoing aRCR by one surgeon with minimum 1-year follow-up were grouped into those under (CP) or outside (non-CP) workers or vehicle accident compensation schemes, matched by age and gender. RTW status and time were assessed using chi-square analysis and multivariable linear regression.

Results Of 1054 available patients, 90 CP patients were identified with 29 consented and matched to non-CP (N=29). A higher proportion of CP patients (17.2 vs 0%, P<0.001) never returned to work and a lower proportion resumed pre-injury duties at first RTW (3 vs 52%, P<0.01). Median time to first RTW did not differ between CP and non-CP groups (5.1 vs 4.4, P=0.86). Smoking (P=0.007) and post-injury activity level (P=0.004) were significantly associated with longer time to first RTW, whereas compensation status was not.

Conclusions CP patients undergoing aRCR in NSW are at risk of not returning to work. For those that do return, there is no significant difference compared to non-CP in time to first RTW. Particularly, patient and management factors associated with extended time to first RTW have been identified. Interventions aimed at modifiable factors such as smoking cessation and increasing preoperative activity may improve future outcomes.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Aims Determine factors affecting first return to work (RTW) status and time in patients treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (aRCR) under state-based compensation schemes in New South Wales, Australia, compared to those outside such schemes.

Material and Methods Patients undergoing aRCR by one surgeon with minimum 1-year follow-up were grouped into those under (CP) or outside (non-CP) workers or vehicle accident compensation schemes, matched by age and gender. RTW status and time were assessed using chi-square analysis and multivariable linear regression.

Results Of 1054 available patients, 90 CP patients were identified with 29 consented and matched to non-CP (N=29). A higher proportion of CP patients (17.2 vs 0%, P<0.001) never returned to work and a lower proportion resumed pre-injury duties at first RTW (3 vs 52%, P<0.01). Median time to first RTW did not differ between CP and non-CP groups (5.1 vs 4.4, P=0.86). Smoking (P=0.007) and post-injury activity level (P=0.004) were significantly associated with longer time to first RTW, whereas compensation status was not.

Conclusions CP patients undergoing aRCR in NSW are at risk of not returning to work. For those that do return, there is no significant difference compared to non-CP in time to first RTW. Particularly, patient and management factors associated with extended time to first RTW have been identified. Interventions aimed at modifiable factors such as smoking cessation and increasing preoperative activity may improve future outcomes.

                              Of 1054 available patients, 90 CP patients were identified with 29 consented and matched to non-CP (N=29). A higher proportion of CP patients (17.2 vs 0%, P<0.001) never returned to work and a lower proportion resumed pre-injury duties at first RTW (3 vs 52%, P<0.01). Median time to first RTW did not differ between CP and non-CP groups (5.1 vs 4.4, P=0.86). Smoking (P=0.007) and post-injury activity level (P=0.004) were significantly associated with longer time to first RTW, whereas compensation status was not.

                              CP patients undergoing aRCR in NSW are at risk of not returning to work. For those that do return, there is no significant difference compared to non-CP in time to first RTW. Particularly, patient and management factors associated with extended time to first RTW have been identified. Interventions aimed at modifiable factors such as smoking cessation and increasing preoperative activity may improve future outcomes.

                             RTW time and status after aRCR for work-related injuries are governed by patient and contextual factors. Compensable patients have reported significantly worse outcomes up to one year postoperatively [

                             The relationship between postoperative outcomes and RTW time, however, remains unclear.

Facilitating RTW in the broader context of work-related injury and occupational disease requires a multidisciplinary approach, with age, gender, injury type, intervention duration, employer interest and employee motivation found to affect RTW (N=9850) [

                             ]. Participants with interested employers were 23 times more likely to RTW than those without, and those with longer intervention periods (>5 months) were less likely to RTW.

                             From the perspective of RTW stakeholders (employers, insurers, lawyers and healthcare providers) in Australia, the factors rated as having the greatest influence on RTW were predominantly psychosocial and modifiable [

                             While compensable patients typically report poorer outcomes and take longer to RTW than their non-compensated counterparts, there is considerable variation in the definitions of RTW status, which may be reported as first, final, pre-injury duties, part-time, same role, same employer but modified role, or otherwise unspecified. This presents a challenge when comparing RTW as an outcome between studies. Furthermore, whether this holds true in the Australian population remains unexplored, and the effect of modifiable factors on first RTW status and time away from work in this population are unclear. This study aims to determine the patient, pathology, treatment and postoperative management factors associated with RTW status and RTW time in patients presenting with RC pathology treated with aRCR under an Australian workers compensation scheme, compared to patients treated outside such schemes.

Patients indemnified under the New South Wales (NSW), Australia workers or motor vehicle accident compensable schemes (compensable patients; CP), were age- and gender-matched to controls treated outside any compensable scheme (non-compensable patients; non-CP). Exclusion criteria included patients withholding consent, were not contactable, had associated glenohumeral arthritis or shoulder instability with RC tear, or had previous pathology in the same shoulder (managed operatively or non-operatively). Non-CP patients were additionally excluded if they were non-privately funded. The non-CP group was matched to the CP group by age (within 5% range at first pass, and 10% range at second pass) and gender. Ethical clearance for this study was obtained from Bellberry Limited (HREC 2018-07-597-A-1) and the study was conducted in accordance with the National Statement for Ethical Conduct in Research (AUS) and the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 Rev).

Continuous variables were assessed for normality using Anderson-Darling tests and summarised by median and interquartile range (IQR). List-wise deletion was used for missing values in univariate analyses. Matched pairs were compared for continuous variables using one-sample Wilcoxon t-test and for 2×2 comparisons of categorical data using McNemar’s test of association. Categorical variables with multiple responses were compared between groups using chi-squared analysis.

                             This study aimed to determine factors associated with first RTW status and time in patients undergoing aRCR under and outside an Australian workers compensation scheme, as the effects of modifiable factors on RTW in this population remain unexplored. This is the first study comparing outcomes of aRCR in a compensable patient group, compared to a set of age- and gender-matched controls. Of the CP cohort (N=29), 83% returned to work in some capacity, but only 3% first returned to pre-injury duties at an average of 5.1 weeks. Larger proportions of CP cohorts (64-94%) have been reported to return to pre-injury duties or normal activities by 7.6-9.8 months [

                             Elucidating modifiable factors affecting RTW in the context of a compensation scheme requires further work. There has been limited examination of factors specific to RTW in aRCR, and current literature lacks adequately powered case-control studies with prospectively collected outcome-centred data. The use of outcome variables also requires some level of standardisation, pertaining to first and final RTW status and the definition of RTW capacity. A deeper understanding of the compensation process, and its interaction with modifiable factors affecting RTW outcomes is also required. Data generated from compensation claim forms is currently inadequate to predict failure to RTW within the NSW workers compensation scheme [

                             ]. Key targets for intervention identified in this investigation are smoking status, and the preoperative activity level of the patient. However, further work is required to establish whether interventions designed to modify these factors are able to favourably affect patient outcomes.

                             This study is, to the best of the authors knowledge, the first to report a case-control series, and the first to review an Australian cohort receiving aRCR under a compensable scheme. The novelty of the results however, must be interpreted in light of certain limitations. Firstly, the observational design, combining retrospective chart review with phone follow-up is a weaker design in the present context. However, care was taken to match between CP and non-CP patients for known characteristics (age and gender). Nevertheless, future work should incorporate more robust prospective designs to establish stronger quality evidence for findings described here. Secondly the low consent rate (∼30%) from the CP group dictated a relatively small sample size compared to the published data to-date. Significant associations between outcomes and patient and postoperative management factors have been found that align with published literature, however care has been taken to not overfit the regression model on a small sample size.

                             There remains unexplained variance in the results, which may, to some degree, be accounted for by reporting, recruitment and performer bias. The patient groups were documented differently with work cover certificates used for CP patients and postoperative surgical correspondence used for non-CP patients (reporting bias), CP patients may have been influenced by the belief that participation may impact their claim status or established economic benefits (recruitment bias), and CP patients had better access to postoperative rehabilitation including physiotherapy and exercise physiology (performer boas). The effect of changes to the surgical procedure over a decade, though seemingly irrelevant, also cannot be disregarded. Future work requires clearer definitions of outcomes variables and timepoints, and would be greatly improved with a prospective study design with higher quality patient-centred data.

                             In conclusion, patients receiving aRCR under workers compensation schemes in one Australian jurisdiction are at increased risk of not returning to work compared to patients presenting outside a compensable scheme or in equivalent schemes internationally. Regardless of compensation status however, smokers and those with lower preoperative activity levels are at an increased risk of extended time to first return to work after aRCR. Further effort is required to determine if interventions aimed at altering the modifiable risk factors may improve outcomes for these patients.
