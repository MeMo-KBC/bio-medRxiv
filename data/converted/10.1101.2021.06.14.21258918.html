  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Background Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome, and the identification of clinical subphenotypes is essential. Although organ dysfunction is a defining element of sepsis, subphenotypes of differential trajectory are not well studied. We sought to identify distinct Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score trajectory-based subphenotypes in sepsis.

Methods We created 72-hour SOFA score trajectories in patients with sepsis from four diverse intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts. We then used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compute heterogeneous SOFA trajectory similarities and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) to identify trajectory-based subphenotypes. Patient characteristics were compared between subphenotypes and a random forest model was developed to predict subphenotype membership at 6 and 24 hours after being admitted to the ICU. The model was tested on three validation cohorts. Sensitivity analyses were performed with alternative clustering methodologies.

Results A total of 4678, 3665, 12282, and 4804 unique sepsis patients were included in development and three validation cohorts, respectively. Four subphenotypes were identified in the development cohort: Rapidly Worsening (n=612, 13.1%), Delayed Worsening (n=960, 20.5%), Rapidly Improving (n=1932, 41.3%) and Delayed Improving (n=1174, 25.1%). Baseline characteristics, including the pattern of organ dysfunction varied between subphenotypes. Rapidly Worsening was defined by a higher comorbidity burden, acidosis, and visceral organ dysfunction. Rapidly Improving was defined by vasopressor use without acidosis. Outcomes differed across the subphenotypes, Rapidly Worsening had the highest in-hospital mortality (28.3%, p-value<0.001), despite a lower SOFA (mean: 4.5) at ICU admission compared to Rapidly Improving (mortality:5.5%, mean SOFA: 5.5). An overall prediction accuracy of 0.78 (95% CI, [0.77, 0.8]) was obtained at 6 hours after ICU admission, which increased to 0.87 (95% CI, [0.86, 0.88]) at 24 hours. Similar subphenotypes were replicated in three validation cohorts. The majority of patients with sepsis have an improving phenotype with a lower mortality risk, however they make up over 20% of all deaths due to their larger numbers.

Conclusions Four novel, clinically-defined, trajectory-based sepsis subphenotypes were identified and validated. Identifying trajectory-based subphenotypes has immediate implications for the powering and predictive enrichment of clinical trials. Understanding the pathophysiology of these differential trajectories may reveal unanticipated therapeutic targets and identify more precise populations and endpoints for clinical trials.

                               Background
                              </strong>
                              Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome, and the identification of clinical subphenotypes is essential. Although organ dysfunction is a defining element of sepsis, subphenotypes of differential trajectory are not well studied. We sought to identify distinct Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score trajectory-based subphenotypes in sepsis.

                              </strong>
                              We created 72-hour SOFA score trajectories in patients with sepsis from four diverse intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts. We then used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compute heterogeneous SOFA trajectory similarities and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) to identify trajectory-based subphenotypes. Patient characteristics were compared between subphenotypes and a random forest model was developed to predict subphenotype membership at 6 and 24 hours after being admitted to the ICU. The model was tested on three validation cohorts. Sensitivity analyses were performed with alternative clustering methodologies.

                              A total of 4678, 3665, 12282, and 4804 unique sepsis patients were included in development and three validation cohorts, respectively. Four subphenotypes were identified in the development cohort: Rapidly Worsening (n=612, 13.1%), Delayed Worsening (n=960, 20.5%), Rapidly Improving (n=1932, 41.3%) and Delayed Improving (n=1174, 25.1%). Baseline characteristics, including the pattern of organ dysfunction varied between subphenotypes. Rapidly Worsening was defined by a higher comorbidity burden, acidosis, and visceral organ dysfunction. Rapidly Improving was defined by vasopressor use without acidosis. Outcomes differed across the subphenotypes, Rapidly Worsening had the highest in-hospital mortality (28.3%, p-value<0.001), despite a lower SOFA (mean: 4.5) at ICU admission compared to Rapidly Improving (mortality:5.5%, mean SOFA: 5.5). An overall prediction accuracy of 0.78 (95% CI, [0.77, 0.8]) was obtained at 6 hours after ICU admission, which increased to 0.87 (95% CI, [0.86, 0.88]) at 24 hours. Similar subphenotypes were replicated in three validation cohorts. The majority of patients with sepsis have an improving phenotype with a lower mortality risk, however they make up over 20% of all deaths due to their larger numbers.

                              Four novel, clinically-defined, trajectory-based sepsis subphenotypes were identified and validated. Identifying trajectory-based subphenotypes has immediate implications for the powering and predictive enrichment of clinical trials. Understanding the pathophysiology of these differential trajectories may reveal unanticipated therapeutic targets and identify more precise populations and endpoints for clinical trials.

                             leveraged a matrix factorization based approach to identify multiple organ dysfunction syndrome subphenotypes according to longitudinal pediatric SOFA (pSOFA) scores, but their approach was focusing on the subphenotypes captured by the “motifs”, or frequent subsequence patterns, of the SOFA trajectories, which may not characterize the long term trends encoded in those trajectories well. However, whether the trajectory of multisystem organ failure is associated with distinct phenotypic patterns in sepsis remains largely unexplored. Identifying distinct subphenotypes of organ dysfunction trajectory in sepsis can refine our understanding of the natural history of sepsis in the ICU in response to standard of care treatment and define patterns of disease that may benefit from novel therapeutic strategies.

This method can capture the differences among the evolution heterogeneity in terms of the temporal curves, which can assess similarity between patients robustly. HAC was then used to perform clustering among patients based on the similarities obtained from DTW. Multiple clustering indices (Supplemental Appendix 7) were calculated to determine the optimal numbers of subphenotypes.

Specifically, in the development cohort, the Rapidly Worsening subphenotype (n=612, 13.1%) was characterized by continuously increased SOFA scores from a mean (SD) of 4.5 (2.8) at admission to more than 7 at 72 hours. This subphenotype had the fewest patients. The Delayed Worsening subphenotype (n=960, 20.5%) was characterized by decreased SOFA scores within the first 48 hours from a mean (SD) of 5.2 (2.7) at baseline to 3.7 (2.8), followed by an increase over the last 24 hours. The Rapidly Improving subphenotype (n=1,932, 41.3%) was characterized by a consistent continuous improvement in SOFA scores from a mean (SD) of 5.54 (2.9) at baseline to less than 3. This was the most common subphenotype and it had the highest SOFA score at baseline. The Delayed Improving subphenotype (n=1,174, 25.1%) was characterized by an increase and then a gradual decrease in SOFA score over 72 hours. It had the lowest SOFA score at baseline with mean (SD) 4.0 (2.4). Similar trajectory trends were obtained in all three validation cohorts (

The Rapidly Worsening group was more likely to have patients with abnormal cardiovascular biomarkers (bicarbonate, troponin T or I, lactate) and hematologic (such as hemoglobin, INR, platelet, glucose, RDW). Patients in this subphenotype had a higher chronic comorbidity burden and had abnormal SOFA subscores including respiration, coagulation and liver. The Rapidly Improving patients were more likely to have abnormal inflammatory lab values (temperature, WBC, bands, CRP, albumin, lymphocyte percent) and abnormal cardiovascular, CNS and renal SOFA subscores. There was a lower chronic comorbidity burden in this subphenotype. Delayed Worsening group had more abnormal hematologic and respiration, coagulation, CNS, and SOFA renal subscores. Abnormal respiration, coagulation, cardiovascular SOFA subscores were strongly associated with Delayed Improving. The characteristics on validation cohorts are provided in Supplemental Appendix 4 and Tables S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, and S12. The associations between all comorbidities and subphenotypes were investigated and shown in Supplemental Tables S16, S17, S18, and S19. Multiple comorbidities such as congestive heart failure, renal failure, liver disease, cancer showed the differences among subphenotypes.

Patients’ memberships of the four subphenotypes re-derived by GBTM were highly consistent with those obtained from HAC (Supplemental Figure S9), and thus we did not find substantial changes in clinical characteristics of those subphenotypes derived from the sensitivity analysis (Supplemental Table S13).

                              We trained random forest models for predicting subphenotypes according to early-stage patient characteristics.

For example, creatinine, bicarbonate, RDW, and BUN contributes more for predicting the Rapidly Improving group, while platelet, INR, AST and lactate contributed more to the prediction of the Rapidly Worsening group. The prediction performance at successive time points are shown in Supplemental Figure S18. The accuracy increased to 0.87 (95% CI [0.86, 0.88]) in development cohort and 0.86 (95% CI [0.85, 0.88]), 0.86 (95% CI [0.85, 0.87]), and 0.84 (95% CI [0.83, 0.85]) in NMEDW, eICU, and CEDAR validation cohorts at the 24 hours after ICU admission, respectively.

                             We reported four sepsis subphenotypes based on dynamic organ dysfunction trajectories using a data-driven methodology. DTW was used to calculate patients’ SOFA trajectory similarities because of its capability of capturing heterogeneous evolution among the temporal sequences robustly, based on which HAC was leveraged to identify patient groups with similar trajectories. The subphenotypes identified were Rapidly Worsening, Delayed Worsening, Rapidly Improving, and Delayed Improving. Patients in the Rapidly Worsening subphenotype had progressive organ dysfunction with the ongoing ICU stay. The two Delayed groups had unstable organ dysfunction over the study period and the Rapidly Improving group had the highest admission organ dysfunction but quickly improved. Outcomes followed SOFA trajectory across each subphenotype were irrespective of traditional baseline SOFA score and septic shock categories.

                             A major strength of this analysis is that we have identified time-dependent progression patterns that may be related to the differential response of specific organ dysfunction to standard of care interventions. For example, the Rapidly Improving group had cardiovascular and respiratory failure at admission that resolved over 72 hours. The Rapidly Worsening groups developed multisystem organ failure including visceral organ dysfunction, specifically liver failure in addition to cardiovascular and respiratory failure. These differential patterns suggest varying time-dependent, treatment responsive organ dysfunction pathophysiology in sepsis. The cardiovascular and respiratory subscores are driven by the vasopressor dose and PaO2/FiO2 respectively, which may respond to therapeutic interventions such as corticosteroids, volume resuscitation, and the application of PEEP or therapeutic suctioning.

                             Our study highlights that patterns of organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis are Rapidly Improving, Rapidly Worsening and Delayed. Each of these patterns may be due to a different pathophysiology and benefit from different treatments in the future. However, these findings have immediate implications for those designing clinical trial endpoints such as change in SOFA subscore.

                             It deserves noting that our Rapidly Improving patients had better outcomes across all patients studied, but still represented 21%, 36%, 21%, and 24% of all deaths in our development and validation cohorts (NMEDW, eICU, and CEDAR cohorts) respectively, despite an overall 5%, 10%, 5%, and 9% in-hospital mortality. This low mortality rate but high numbers of absolute deaths highlights that further research is needed to understand the cause of death in patients with rapidly improving organ dysfunction in sepsis.

                             The potential for distinct pathophysiologic etiologies for the differential trajectories is supported by the differential patterns of organ dysfunction, infectious source, vital signs, inflammatory, hematologic, and cardiovascular variables at admission to the ICU.

For example, those patients of Rapidly Improving were more likely to have more abnormal inflammatory markers (such as WBC, bands, albumin, temperature, lymphocyte) and more abnormal values on cardiovascular, and CNS subscores. They were also more likely to have urosepsis. There was a lower comorbidity score in patients with this subphenotype, which suggests that sepsis outcomes may be more dependent on underlying illness. The Rapidly Worsening patients had more comorbidities and distinct derangements in clinical variables associated with metabolic acidosis and hypoperfusion, e.g. a low bicarbonate and higher lactate, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, e.g. low platelets and a higher INR and respiratory failure. Both of the Delayed subphenotypes had less specific variables associated with group membership, including inflammatory, hepatic, hematologic and pulmonary associated with Delayed Improvement and hematologic, cardiovascular and renal variables associated with Delayed Worsening. These differences may be related to secular trends in therapeutics and differing case mixes in each cohort.

                             We built multivariable prediction models for the identified trajectory subphenotypes from patient baseline characteristics and early-stage clinical features. Several interesting findings were obtained. (1) A high comorbidity score tended to predict the subphenotypes of Rapidly Worsening because patients with high comorbidity burden were more likely to present worse organ dysfunction in ICU; (2) The roles of lab tests and vital signs were different on prediction. For example, low Platelets had a positive impact on the Rapidly Worsening prediction and high Platelets had a positive impact on the Rapidly Improving prediction. These prediction models may enhance the clinical utility of the identified subphenotypes in practice, as they can be predicted with the EHR information captured within the early hours of ICU admission, especially for Rapid Improving and Rapid Worsening subphenotypes, which has important clinical implications as discussed above. Our model can be implemented within the EHR system as a risk calculator for subphenotype assignments.

                             There is some overlap in our high risk groups, notably both include liver injury and shock. However, our work demonstrates that the difference in outcome in this group is due to progressive non-resolving organ dysfunction that calls for novel treatments. Prior work by Ferreira et al and Sakr et al used changes in the SOFA score after ICU admission to improve prognostic stratification in sepsis, but did not use these changes to establish subphenotypes. Bhavani et al. used longitudinal temperature trajectories to identify four sepsis subphenotypes, with significant variability in inflammatory markers and outcomes, highlighting the potential for novel immune signatures to be uncovered through trajectory analysis.

                             This study has several limitations. First, our sepsis subphenotypes were identified based on the data-driven method, which may not be directly related to underlying differences in biology. Integration of biological data may help refine our understanding of differential disease progression and the potential for therapeutics to alter the course. Second, although we used many separate hospitals in validation, all of them are located in the United States, which may limit generalizability to other locations of care. Moreover, these observational cohorts may not directly reflect sepsis clinical trial populations but are representative of academic and community hospitals across the United States. Third, we did not evaluate the effect of specific randomized interventions on SOFA score trajectory. Fourth, this identified sepsis subphenotypes only focused on patients admitted to an ICU, which is subject to differences in ICU admission practices across institutions. Last but not the least, we did not investigate the association between care processes and the subphenotypes, which would be an important topic in future research.
