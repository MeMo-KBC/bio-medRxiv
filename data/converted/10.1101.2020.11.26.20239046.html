  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background and aims Knee extension deficits complicate recovery from ACL injury and reconstruction, however the incidence of knee extension loss is not well defined. The aim of this review was to identify the incidence of loss of extension (LOE) following ACL rupture and reconstruction, explore the definitions of knee extension deficits reported and identify prognostic factors affecting LOE incidence.

Methods and analysis A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Cochrane Library and PEDro for studies in publication up to November 2021, with no restrictions on publication year. References were screened and assessed for inclusion using predetermined eligibility criteria. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that quantified knee angle, loss of extension or incidence of extension deficit were included for quality assessment and data extraction. Statistical summaries were generated and meta-analyses performed in two parts to examine: (i) the probability of a datapoint being zero incidence compared to a non-zero incidence, and (ii) the relationship between the predictors and non-zero LOE incidence.

Results A sample of 15494 papers were retrieved using the search criteria, with 53 studies meeting eligibility criteria. Pooled results from 4991 participants were included for analysis, with 4891 participants who had undergone ACLR. The proportion of included studies judged at an overall low risk of bias was small (7.8%). The observed group and study were the most important predictors for whether a datapoint reported an incidence of extension deficit. Time to follow up (P < 0.001) and graft type (P = 0.02) were found to have a significant influence on non-zero LOE incidence (%). Covariate adjusted estimates of average LOE indicated 1 in 3 patients presenting with LOE at 12months followup, reducing to 1 in 4 at 2 years.

Conclusions This review examined the definitions for the measurement and interpretation of postoperative knee extension, and established the trajectory of knee extension deficit after ACL injury and reconstruction. While factors associated with loss of extension were identified, the exact trajectory of knee extension deficits were difficult to infer due to discrepancies in measurement techniques and patient variation. Clinicians should expect up to 1 in 3 patients to present postoperatively with loss of extension of at least 3 degrees, which may resolve in some patients over time. Future work should focus on LOE as a clinically relevant complication of ACL injury and treatment with appropriate attention to standardisation of definitions, measurements and better understanding of natural history.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background and aims Knee extension deficits complicate recovery from ACL injury and reconstruction, however the incidence of knee extension loss is not well defined. The aim of this review was to identify the incidence of loss of extension (LOE) following ACL rupture and reconstruction, explore the definitions of knee extension deficits reported and identify prognostic factors affecting LOE incidence.

Methods and analysis A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Cochrane Library and PEDro for studies in publication up to November 2021, with no restrictions on publication year. References were screened and assessed for inclusion using predetermined eligibility criteria. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that quantified knee angle, loss of extension or incidence of extension deficit were included for quality assessment and data extraction. Statistical summaries were generated and meta-analyses performed in two parts to examine: (i) the probability of a datapoint being zero incidence compared to a non-zero incidence, and (ii) the relationship between the predictors and non-zero LOE incidence.

Results A sample of 15494 papers were retrieved using the search criteria, with 53 studies meeting eligibility criteria. Pooled results from 4991 participants were included for analysis, with 4891 participants who had undergone ACLR. The proportion of included studies judged at an overall low risk of bias was small (7.8%). The observed group and study were the most important predictors for whether a datapoint reported an incidence of extension deficit. Time to follow up (P < 0.001) and graft type (P = 0.02) were found to have a significant influence on non-zero LOE incidence (%). Covariate adjusted estimates of average LOE indicated 1 in 3 patients presenting with LOE at 12months followup, reducing to 1 in 4 at 2 years.

Conclusions This review examined the definitions for the measurement and interpretation of postoperative knee extension, and established the trajectory of knee extension deficit after ACL injury and reconstruction. While factors associated with loss of extension were identified, the exact trajectory of knee extension deficits were difficult to infer due to discrepancies in measurement techniques and patient variation. Clinicians should expect up to 1 in 3 patients to present postoperatively with loss of extension of at least 3 degrees, which may resolve in some patients over time. Future work should focus on LOE as a clinically relevant complication of ACL injury and treatment with appropriate attention to standardisation of definitions, measurements and better understanding of natural history.

                              Knee extension deficits complicate recovery from ACL injury and reconstruction, however the incidence of knee extension loss is not well defined. The aim of this review was to identify the incidence of loss of extension (LOE) following ACL rupture and reconstruction, explore the definitions of knee extension deficits reported and identify prognostic factors affecting LOE incidence.

                              A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Cochrane Library and PEDro for studies in publication up to November 2021, with no restrictions on publication year. References were screened and assessed for inclusion using predetermined eligibility criteria. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that quantified knee angle, loss of extension or incidence of extension deficit were included for quality assessment and data extraction. Statistical summaries were generated and meta-analyses performed in two parts to examine: (i) the probability of a datapoint being zero incidence compared to a non-zero incidence, and (ii) the relationship between the predictors and non-zero LOE incidence.

                              A sample of 15494 papers were retrieved using the search criteria, with 53 studies meeting eligibility criteria. Pooled results from 4991 participants were included for analysis, with 4891 participants who had undergone ACLR. The proportion of included studies judged at an overall low risk of bias was small (7.8%). The observed group and study were the most important predictors for whether a datapoint reported an incidence of extension deficit. Time to follow up (P < 0.001) and graft type (P = 0.02) were found to have a significant influence on non-zero LOE incidence (%). Covariate adjusted estimates of average LOE indicated 1 in 3 patients presenting with LOE at 12months followup, reducing to 1 in 4 at 2 years.

                              This review examined the definitions for the measurement and interpretation of postoperative knee extension, and established the trajectory of knee extension deficit after ACL injury and reconstruction. While factors associated with loss of extension were identified, the exact trajectory of knee extension deficits were difficult to infer due to discrepancies in measurement techniques and patient variation. Clinicians should expect up to 1 in 3 patients to present postoperatively with loss of extension of at least 3 degrees, which may resolve in some patients over time. Future work should focus on LOE as a clinically relevant complication of ACL injury and treatment with appropriate attention to standardisation of definitions, measurements and better understanding of natural history.

                             Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture can have a long-lasting negative impact on a person’s health and quality of life. Treatments for ACL rupture comprise conservative non-operative management (such as activity modification, bracing or physical and activity based therapies), surgical repair, biological therapies or reconstruction of the ligament offered as a first-line treatment in some patients or following failed nonoperative management in others

Patients who undergo ACLR present with fewer subsequent meniscal injuries, lower incidence of subsequent surgery, and significantly improved activity levels compared to patients receiving non-operative management of their ACL rupture

As such, the natural trajectory of knee extension following ACL rupture and true incidence of extension deficits after surgical reconstruction remains largely unknown, limiting the ability to develop standardised benchmarks for postoperative monitoring of knee extension recovery after ACL reconstruction.

Screening and extracted data was stored on a cloud-based database (G Suite, Google, California, USA) and summarised to perform statistical analysis and meta-analysis where deemed eligible.

Domain ratings using the algorithm were overridden if considered inaccurate relative to the type of study. Overall risk of bias for included studies was scored “Low risk” where the study was judged to be at a low risk of bias across all domains; overall risk of bias was scored as “Some concerns” where the assessor raised some concern in at least one domain, but not at “High risk” for any domain; studies were judged at overall “High risk” where a high risk was captured in at least one domain, or some concerns were noted in multiple domains

                              .To identify factors that may be associated with the reported LOE incidence and estimate an adjusted LOE incidence, the analysis was conducted in two parts. The first part examined the probability of a datapoint being zero incidence compared to a non-zero incidence (classification analysis). The LOE incidence was re-coded to a binary categorical variable (detected; not detected). The predictor set was manually identified from the data items extracted. The main criteria for inclusion of a predictor was i) sufficient variation in responses; and ii) sufficient coverage in reporting (low rate of missingness). A feature reduction technique based on mutual information (MI) criterion was implemented to reduce the number of categorical predictors

The model error was retrieved as an indicator of model fit and predictors were ranked based on the classification error attributed to each predictor. The second part of the metaregression provided an adjusted estimate of LOE by firstly subsetting the data based on non-zero incidence of LOE and assessed the relationship between the predictors and LOE incidence. A weighted (by study sample size) generalised mixed-effects linear model (normal distribution, Laplace fit method) was applied. Fixed effects incorporated study methodology, surgical technique, followup timing and risk of bias. Random effects were group identifiers nested within studies. Overall model fit was assessed with adjusted R

Studies that did define “full extension” of the knee to determine degree of extension loss used varied definitions

Knee extension measured with a goniometer, compared to the contralateral limb, with a 3 degree threshold to define a loss of extension, appeared to be the most common approach (Table E). Cutoff thresholds to determine the incidence of extension deficit (relative to full extension) also varied between studies.

The reduced predictor set for classification component of analysis, after screening included the following variables: paper and group ID; time of follow up; average age at follow up; graft type; movement paradigm; sample size, graft placement/approach; randomisation factor; tissue type. The misclassification error for the model was found to be 16.7%, suggesting that the reduced predictor set provided a reasonable fit to the data. The model indicated that the study and observed group within the study were the most important factors for whether a timepoint was reported as undetected (incidence <1%) or otherwise, followed by time to follow up and graft type (

                             The primary objective of this review was to identify the incidence of loss of knee extension angle in patients diagnosed with ACL rupture electing to undergo formal treatment under the care of a registered clinical provider (including non-operative and arthroscopic ACL reconstruction) compared to the contralateral limb or control patients, as reported within randomised control studies. We report an overall average incidence of 31.5% (95%CI 30.4 - 32.7) at 12months. The secondary objective of this review was to explore the manner in which knee extension deficits have been reported and defined across the literature. We have noted substantial variability within the reporting of characteristics of LOE measurement across studies, including differences in the definition of a “normal” or “full” extension comparator for determining the degree of deficit, thresholds for categorising LOE and whether the ROM was determined via an active or passive movement paradigm (

                             Factors affecting the incidence of extension deficits were also examined in this systematic review. The general findings from the classification analysis revealed that the group in which the study participants were placed and studies themselves were the most important predictors for whether a time point was to detect an incidence of extension deficit or reported as undetected (incidence <1%). These results suggest that methodological differences in the papers contributed substantially to the reporting of LOE. In the majority of trials, LOE was reported as a secondary outcome, with definitions and measurement methods poorly reported. It is likely that at least some studies operationally defined LOE as symptomatic presentations, leading to selective measurement. This highlights the methodological limitations of the systematic review and potential influences of author bias, author background/specialties, interests and motivations, or regional / socioeconomic / cultural factors on the study design, and hence the detection of LOE within the cohorts of the included sample of studies. The predictor importance rankings for timing of data collection (or length of follow up), graft type and movement paradigm are further suggestive that the methodologies employed within the studies are also important determinants on reported LOE incidence.

                             . While re-operation is occasionally required to treat severe extension deficits, cases where extension deficits resolve without further operative intervention and the cross-sectional findings of the present review suggest there may be an innate process by which ROM is recovered. The significant association between length of followup and LOE incidence identified by metaregression further supports this notion. We hypothesise that in these cases where knee extension recovers spontaneously, other processes such as soft tissue remodelling may be the primary mechanism. Of particular interest to note is the significant association between graft type used in ACL reconstruction on LOE incidence identified in this review, suggesting that graft type itself may contribute to the processes involved in extension recovery. However, this should be interpreted with caution due to limitations of the data analysis package which referenced the “not-reported” label for the graft type variable category, and limited number of datapoints available for analysis pertaining to studies reporting the use of allografts, which is further reflected by the wide confidence intervals observed around the fixed effect coefficient. While identifying the mechanism by which knee extension is recovered was outside the scope of this review, approximately 43% of included studies to this review were randomised based on graft type, indicating graft type remains an area of interest, and could guide future research objectives.

                             While the primary focus of this systematic review was to summarise the outcomes of interest within studies of randomised controlled design to improve the body of evidence, limitations stemming from poor standardisation and reporting of measurement methods, definition of knee angle and extension comparator across studies should be considered. The t-norm conversion to estimate the incidence of LOE for studies reporting knee angle or loss of extension angle may have possibly introduced errors within the meta-analysis due to its assumption of normal distribution for knee extension. When combined with the classification analysis and regression modelling, the methods described were considered most appropriate for determining overall incidence of extension deficits within the included sample of studies and for identifying factors that may be associated with the LOE incidence. However the influence of factors such as BMI or time to intervention were unable to be inferred due to the substantial rates of non-reporting. Further to this, substantial risks of bias were detected across a notable number of studies, with upwards of half the included studies scoring a high risk of bias in at least one domain, or multiple judgements of some concern across multiple domains. It may be noted that knee extension angle, the degree of extension deficit or incidence of LOE were often not the primary outcome of the study, rendering them less sensitive to detecting an incidence of LOE in the study and contributing to the biases detected with respect to the measurement, presentation and reporting of findings for these metrics. We note that the limited prioritisation of knee extension as an outcome in its own right within the included randomised trials is a likely contributor to the issues identified. Other factors suspected of influence over short-term postoperative knee extension, such as graft tensioning (tension magnitude and knee angle at which tensioning is achieved) and adjunct stabilisation procedures (e.g. lateral extra-articular tenodesis), may be better explored in non-randomised investigations. Further analysis is recommended on this component of the dataset collected as part of the current work.

                             This review established the trajectory of knee extension incidence after ACL reconstruction in studies of RCT design. Evidence of the incidence and factors associated with loss of extension were identified; however knee extension after ACL reconstruction was measured at variable time points with a variety of measurement techniques across a mixed cohort composition, with poor descriptions of how full extension was standardised. Overall, up to 1 in 3 patients can be expected to present with loss of extension of at least 3 degrees at 12month followup, which may decrease to 1 in 4 at 2 years. Further work is required to better describe the natural history of LOE after ACL injury and reconstruction, with particular attention to the development of standardised methods and objective measurement within accepted movement paradigms.
