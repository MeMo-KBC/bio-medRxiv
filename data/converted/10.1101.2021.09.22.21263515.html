  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background The 2019 novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Almost two years later (early-February 2022), the WHO reported over 383 million cases of the disease caused by the virus with over 5.6 million deaths worldwide. Debate regarding routes of transmission was substantial early in the pandemic; however, airborne transmission emerged as an important consideration. Infectious airborne agents can spread within the built environment through heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Multiple features of HVAC systems can influence transmission (e.g., ventilation, filtration, ultraviolet radiation, humidity). Understanding how HVAC features influence airborne transmission is critical to mitigate the spread of infectious agents.

Objective Given airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, an overview of reviews was conducted to understand what is already known from the scientific literature about how virus transmission may be affected by HVAC design features in the built environment.

Methods Ovid MEDLINE and Compendex were searched from inception to January 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and full text of potentially relevant reviews, using a priori inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews examining effects of HVAC design features on virus transmission. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality using AMSTAR2.

Results Searching identified 361 citations, 45 were potentially relevant, and 7 were included. Reviews were published between 2007 and 2021, and included 47 virus studies. Two earlier reviews (2007, 2016) of 21 studies found sufficient evidence that mechanical ventilation (airflow patterns, ventilation rates) plays a role in airborne transmission; however, both found insufficient evidence to quantify minimum mechanical ventilation requirements. One review (2017) of 9 studies examining humidity and indoor air quality found that influenza virus survival was lowest between 40% and 80% relative humidity; authors noted that ventilation rates were a confounding variable. Two reviews (2021) examined mitigation strategies for coronavirus transmission, finding that transmission decreased with increasing temperature and relative humidity. One review (2020) identified 14 studies examining coronavirus transmission in air conditioning systems, finding HVAC systems played a role in virus spread during previous coronavirus outbreaks. One review (2020) examined virus transmission interventions on public ground transportation, finding ventilation and filtration to be effective.

Conclusions Seven reviews synthesizing 47 studies demonstrate a role for HVAC in mitigating airborne virus transmission. Ventilation, humidity, temperature, and filtration can play a role in viability and transmission of viruses, including coronaviruses. Recommendations for minimum standards were not possible due to few studies investigating a given HVAC parameter. This overview examining HVAC design features and their effects on airborne transmission of viruses serves as a starting point for future systematic reviews and identifying priorities for primary research.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background The 2019 novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Almost two years later (early-February 2022), the WHO reported over 383 million cases of the disease caused by the virus with over 5.6 million deaths worldwide. Debate regarding routes of transmission was substantial early in the pandemic; however, airborne transmission emerged as an important consideration. Infectious airborne agents can spread within the built environment through heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Multiple features of HVAC systems can influence transmission (e.g., ventilation, filtration, ultraviolet radiation, humidity). Understanding how HVAC features influence airborne transmission is critical to mitigate the spread of infectious agents.

Objective Given airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, an overview of reviews was conducted to understand what is already known from the scientific literature about how virus transmission may be affected by HVAC design features in the built environment.

Methods Ovid MEDLINE and Compendex were searched from inception to January 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and full text of potentially relevant reviews, using a priori inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews examining effects of HVAC design features on virus transmission. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality using AMSTAR2.

Results Searching identified 361 citations, 45 were potentially relevant, and 7 were included. Reviews were published between 2007 and 2021, and included 47 virus studies. Two earlier reviews (2007, 2016) of 21 studies found sufficient evidence that mechanical ventilation (airflow patterns, ventilation rates) plays a role in airborne transmission; however, both found insufficient evidence to quantify minimum mechanical ventilation requirements. One review (2017) of 9 studies examining humidity and indoor air quality found that influenza virus survival was lowest between 40% and 80% relative humidity; authors noted that ventilation rates were a confounding variable. Two reviews (2021) examined mitigation strategies for coronavirus transmission, finding that transmission decreased with increasing temperature and relative humidity. One review (2020) identified 14 studies examining coronavirus transmission in air conditioning systems, finding HVAC systems played a role in virus spread during previous coronavirus outbreaks. One review (2020) examined virus transmission interventions on public ground transportation, finding ventilation and filtration to be effective.

Conclusions Seven reviews synthesizing 47 studies demonstrate a role for HVAC in mitigating airborne virus transmission. Ventilation, humidity, temperature, and filtration can play a role in viability and transmission of viruses, including coronaviruses. Recommendations for minimum standards were not possible due to few studies investigating a given HVAC parameter. This overview examining HVAC design features and their effects on airborne transmission of viruses serves as a starting point for future systematic reviews and identifying priorities for primary research.

                               Background
                              </strong>
                              The 2019 novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Almost two years later (early-February 2022), the WHO reported over 383 million cases of the disease caused by the virus with over 5.6 million deaths worldwide. Debate regarding routes of transmission was substantial early in the pandemic; however, airborne transmission emerged as an important consideration. Infectious airborne agents can spread within the built environment through heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Multiple features of HVAC systems can influence transmission (e.g., ventilation, filtration, ultraviolet radiation, humidity). Understanding how HVAC features influence airborne transmission is critical to mitigate the spread of infectious agents.

                              Given airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, an overview of reviews was conducted to understand what is already known from the scientific literature about how virus transmission may be affected by HVAC design features in the built environment.

                              Ovid MEDLINE and Compendex were searched from inception to January 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and full text of potentially relevant reviews, using a priori inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews examining effects of HVAC design features on virus transmission. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality using AMSTAR2.

                              Searching identified 361 citations, 45 were potentially relevant, and 7 were included. Reviews were published between 2007 and 2021, and included 47 virus studies. Two earlier reviews (2007, 2016) of 21 studies found sufficient evidence that mechanical ventilation (airflow patterns, ventilation rates) plays a role in airborne transmission; however, both found insufficient evidence to quantify minimum mechanical ventilation requirements. One review (2017) of 9 studies examining humidity and indoor air quality found that influenza virus survival was lowest between 40% and 80% relative humidity; authors noted that ventilation rates were a confounding variable. Two reviews (2021) examined mitigation strategies for coronavirus transmission, finding that transmission decreased with increasing temperature and relative humidity. One review (2020) identified 14 studies examining coronavirus transmission in air conditioning systems, finding HVAC systems played a role in virus spread during previous coronavirus outbreaks. One review (2020) examined virus transmission interventions on public ground transportation, finding ventilation and filtration to be effective.

                              Seven reviews synthesizing 47 studies demonstrate a role for HVAC in mitigating airborne virus transmission. Ventilation, humidity, temperature, and filtration can play a role in viability and transmission of viruses, including coronaviruses. Recommendations for minimum standards were not possible due to few studies investigating a given HVAC parameter. This overview examining HVAC design features and their effects on airborne transmission of viruses serves as a starting point for future systematic reviews and identifying priorities for primary research.

Previous systematic reviews provide a starting point for understanding what is already known from the scientific literature about HVAC systems and airborne transmission of viruses. A comprehensive synthesis of previous systematic reviews can also help identify knowledge gaps helping to guide and prioritize future primary research. Therefore, we conducted an overview of reviews to identify and synthesize previous systematic reviews on this topic.

                              Inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in Multimedia Appendix 2. We planned to include systematic reviews published in English that searched for and included primary research studies examining the effects of HVAC design features on transmission of viruses. The HVAC features of interest were: mechanical ventilation (ventilation rate, air change, air exchange, airflow); filtration (air filtration, filter type, minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) rating, filter age and/or use, pressure drop, holding capacity, replacement, change frequency); ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, UVGI (power, dose, uniformity of dose, flow rate, bioaerosol inactivation efficiency, location); humidity or relative humidity. Inclusion was staged in two ways. Our primary interest was viruses and we excluded those reviews that were not specific to virus. We were initially interested in systematic reviews defined by the international Cochrane organization as reviews that use a pre-defined, systematic approach and follow standard approaches to search the literature, select studies for inclusion, assess methodological quality of included studies, extract and synthesize/analyze data from the included studies. As we found few systematic reviews meeting these criteria, we included review articles that satisfied specific requirements for methodological approach and objective. For methodological approach requirements, the authors had to search two or more databases, describe inclusion and exclusion criteria, and describe a process for study selection. For objective requirements, the objective of the review had to be related to an HVAC design feature, including ventilation, filtration, ultraviolet radiation, or humidity.

                              The following information was extracted from each review: citation information (e.g., authors, year of publication, country of corresponding author); objectives; search strategy; inclusion/exclusion criteria; settings; population characteristics (as applicable); agent studied (e.g., type of virus, bioaerosol); HVAC design features studied; number and characteristics of studies relevant to this overview’s research question; results (as reported by review authors) and review authors’ conclusions relevant to this overview’s research question. Our primary outcome was quantitative measures of the association between HVAC design features and virus transmission; however, we extracted any results reported by the review authors that were relevant to our research question. One reviewer (LH) extracted data using a pre-defined form. A second reviewer (EK) verified data. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and referring to the relevant publication.

                              We anticipated that the included reviews would not have conducted meta-analyses. We planned to present results in tabular and narrative form. Tables were created describing the reviews, their results (including any quantitative data of associations between HVAC features and virus transmission or proxy outcomes) and conclusions, and their methodological quality. A narrative summary of the findings of each review is provided. We only summarize review findings that were relevant to our research question; for example, if the review included studies of ventilation, humidity, etc. in the outdoor and indoor environment, we only report on studies specific to the indoor (built) environment.

Three studies had limited and four had no investigation of ventilation rates or airflow. Studies involved a variety of settings: hospital, hospital ward, or health clinic (n=9); aircraft (n=3); nursing home (n=3); school (n=2); high-rise apartments (n=2); offices (n=1); and animal cage (n=1). Viral agents included SARS-CoV-1 (n=7), influenza (n=5), measles (n=4), chicken pox (n=2), rhinovirus (n=1), common cold (n=1), and smallpox (n=1). Overall quality was assessed as good for twelve, average for five, and unsatisfactory for four studies. The researchers convened a panel of experts in medicine, public health, and engineering. They used a modified Delphi approach with final consensus meeting to rate the ‘evidentiary threshold’ to support their hypothesis, i.e., direct contribution of ventilation to airborne transmission. Among the virus studies, eight were rated as conclusive, while eight were partly conclusive, and five were non-conclusive. Among the eight conclusive studies, two examined ventilation rates showing higher rates of infection for influenza with lower ventilation rates and six demonstrated an association between airflow patterns and transmission of measles (pediatric office suite), chicken pox (hospital), smallpox (hospital), and SARS-CoV-1 (hospital). In all studies the bioaerosols travelled a “considerable distance” which the reviewers note “seemed to be related to building design” [13,p.12] (e.g., placement of heating radiator, room pressure, functional status of return air outlet). None of the virus studies provided data to support “specification and quantification of the minimum ventilation requirements” [13,p.3].

Two of the four studies found an association between virus incidence rates, self-reported incidence rates, and risk of exposure with HVAC design features. In a retrospective cohort study of a SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in a hospital, authors measured ventilation rates and found that “proximity to index patient associated with transmission” [19,p.668].

The third study found lower incidence of influenza in newer nursing homes that had 100% outside air delivery (compared to older homes with 30-70% recirculated air) and filtered room supply (compared with no filtration) during one season; however, data collected over five subsequent years, reported in the fourth study, found no clear association. None of the studies quantified minimum ventilation requirements.

While the review included around 70 papers, 9 papers examined the effects of humidity on the viability or transmission of airborne viruses. Seven studies were experimental (involving laboratory testing), one paper was a re-analysis of data from one of the experimental studies, and one study involved modelling. Most studies focused on influenza, with one study each examining Columbia SK viruses, murine norovirus, and multiple viruses (influenza, vaccinia, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis and poliomyelitis). Most studies examined a wide range of relative humidity from approximately 5-25% RH at the lower range to 75-100% RH at the upper range. The absolute humidity was approximately 25 g/m

In terms of virus viability, four studies showed a reduction at mid-range RH (i.e., approximately 50% RH). Review authors further noted that five studies showed that “virus survival exhibited a canonical dip between 40 and 80% RH” [20,p.39], and that in almost all cases decline in survival was correlated with increased length of exposure. Three studies examined influenza transmission. One study showed reduced transmission among guinea pigs at 50% versus 20 to 35% RH; however, the same pattern was not found when the researchers analyzed the data based on absolute humidity. A second study examined transmission via coughing using manikins and found five times more infectious virus at 7-23% RH versus greater than 43% RH. A modelling study of influenza virus transmission via coughing showed that the infectious virus concentration was 2.4 times more at 10% RH versus 90% RH after 10 minutes and the ratio increased over time. They also demonstrated that the effect of humidity related to particle size: settling of larger particles and inactivation of smaller particles (<5 µm) with greater humidity. They concluded that inactivation resulting from high relative humidity coupled with ventilation is important to remove smaller particles.

Three observational studies suspected a role of the HVAC system, two studies (both of ship outbreak) did not find evidence of a role of HVAC based on the spatiotemporal distribution of cases, and one study (of restaurant outbreak) showed support of the role of HVAC by computer simulation. Review authors indicated that they were not able to appropriately evaluate the quality of the included studies. Review authors concluded that there is sufficient evidence from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV demonstrating a role of HVAC in airborne transmission of the viruses; however, there was not sufficient evidence that HVAC systems play an important role in the case of SARS-CoV-2. While there is a lack of evidence for SARS-CoV-2, there is not evidence of no role.

Further, doubling the ventilation rate reduced risk similar to use of HEPA masks, and was considered more feasible and cost-effective.

Three papers described themselves as systematic reviews, two were rapid reviews, one was a broad literature survey, and one was described simply as a review. The majority provided detailed research questions, explained study designs considered for inclusion, used a comprehensive search strategy, described the included studies, discussed heterogeneity of results, and reported potential conflicts of interest. None or few reviews provided an a priori protocol, performed study selection and data extraction in duplicate, provided a list of excluded studies, conducted risk of bias assessments of individual studies, or reported on sources of funding for included studies. None of the reviews conducted a meta-analysis; all provided a narrative synthesis of results/observations across included studies. A previous review [

                             ] spoke about the need for more well-designed studies (including representative sampling, clear and consistent measurement methods and reporting of data) with the goal of meta-analysis to integrate results.

                              This comprehensive overview of reviews provides a map of the existing synthesized evidence on the role of HVAC in airborne virus transmission. The earliest review by Li et al [

                              ] published in 2007 found evidence of an association between ventilation rates and airflow patterns in buildings and transmission of viral diseases. Li et al [

                              ] found no studies that provided minimum ventilation requirements to prevent the spread of viral diseases; however, they found one study showing tuberculin conversion was significantly associated with ventilation rates of less than 2 ACH in general patient rooms [

                              ]. Published in 2007 shortly after the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, Li et al called for a “multidisciplinary research culture” [13,p.14] to study outbreaks, as well as smaller scale transmission occurrences, to fill the gap with respect to quantifying minimum ventilation standards in both clinical and non-clinical settings. A subsequent review by Luongo et al [

                              ] published almost ten years later in 2016 included a subset of four of the virus studies identified by Li et al [

                              ] with similar conclusions about the possible association between ventilation features (low outdoor air supply, imbalance in supply and exhaust airflow rates) and airborne virus transmission. Luongo et al [
                              <a id="xref-ref-19-6" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-19">

                              ] also pointed out the lack of data to quantify how mechanical ventilation may affect airborne transmission and the need for more well-designed multi-disciplinary epidemiological studies. More recently in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Chirico et al [
                              <a id="xref-ref-21-8" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21">

                              ] examined HVAC systems and their role in airborne transmission of coronaviruses; they concluded there was sufficient evidence demonstrating an association for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV while there was a lack of evidence for SARS-CoV-2. Derby et al [
                              <a id="xref-ref-20-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-20">

                              ] specifically examined the role of humidity in relation to indoor air quality; the evidence they identified was specific to influenza and showed virus survival was lowest between 40% and 80% RH and survival time decreased with length of exposure to humidity. One of the studies from Noorimotlagh et al [

                              While there is an extensive body of literature examining HVAC and its role in airborne virus transmission, there is lack of empirical evidence to quantify minimum standards for HVAC design features in the built environment. The previous reviews have discussed this gap, stressed the need for methodologically rigorous epidemiological studies involving multiple disciplines (e.g., engineering, medicine, epidemiology, and public health), and discussed considerations for future research. These include specificity of the virus, its construction and envelope composition, the infectious dose, and the particle size containing the virus. Review authors have called for standardizing experimental conditions, measurements, terminology, and reporting, as well as simulating real world conditions [

                              ] noted several confounding variables to be considered when interpreting their findings on humidity and temperature including “variation in air exchange rate, length of organism exposure, variation in the biological structure and routes of entry, variation of pathogen survival on different fomites, and variances in human host response” [20,p.33]. They further noted that the number and complexity of variables to consider “greatly increases the test matrices required” [20,p.39] to build a comprehensive evidence base. Studies have also demonstrated the importance of the positioning of the infected person relative to HVAC features and other occupants, mobility patterns and activities (e.g., type and intensity of respiratory activity) of occupants, time spent within a space, occupancy and occupant density. Despite specification of air flow parameters, the flow of air in occupied spaces is almost always turbulent (versus laminar) such that particles “are constantly mixing and moving in varied ways across a space” making assessments and predictions challenging [

                              ]. Finally, research results need to be interpreted in light of technological differences in HVAC systems around the world [

                              ]. Engineers have developed sophisticated methods (through modelling, computational fluid dynamics, etc.) that allow for isolation of features and control for confounding variables. However, these studies rely on many assumptions that may not hold in real world settings or are specific to an assumed building design or configuration. As well, these studies may isolate one component in the chain of transmission which does not necessarily equate to actual disease (e.g., detection of viral particles vs infectivity vs disease outcomes) [

They proposed as a solution “contemporaneous air-sampling and environmental measurements” [13,p.14] in locations during a patient’s illness, which could be extended to locations of high use or occupancy during a pandemic or seasonal epidemics.

The main limitation stems from the limits of the included reviews. We initially intended to include only systematic reviews that met internationally recognized definitions and methodological expectations. However, we relaxed our criteria given that many reviews did not meet this standard. While most reviews prespecified their research question and conducted a comprehensive search, few conducted study selection and data extraction in duplicate as recommended to avoid bias, and very few assessed the methodological quality or risk of bias of their included studies which is key to determining the validity and certainty of available evidence. We also did not find reviews of all HVAC design features, for example, none of the included reviews examined UVGI (though a recent narrative review has been published in the context of COVID-19 [

First, ventilation rates and air flow patterns have been shown to associate with virus transmission. Second, humidity and temperature associate with virus survival. Third, filtration can be effective in removing pathogens if the filter rating is commensurate with the size of the particles of interest [

While one review did not find sufficient evidence of HVAC and airborne transmission specific to SARS-CoV-2, authors did advise (based on evidence for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1) that attention be given to design and management of HVAC systems as a precautionary measure until further evidence indicates otherwise [

                             Airborne transmission is now recognized as a route of transmission for different viruses including coronaviruses and specifically SARS-CoV-2 which has been the source of immense global impacts in terms of morbidity, mortality, and peripheral effects of pandemic restrictions. HVAC systems and their specific features have the potential to mitigate transmission in the built environment: there is evidence that ventilation rates, airflow patterns, humidity, temperature, and filtration can influence virus transmission. Enhancing HVAC systems in the built environment (including schools, office buildings, commercial spaces, recreation centers, transport vehicles, etc.) could have important implications for the current pandemic as well as seasonal epidemics and other diseases and impacts that are associated with general indoor air quality. These measures will be of utmost relevance to countries that experience cooler climates and where people spend an inordinate amount of time (80-90%) indoors. Moreover, mitigation strategies that do not rely on human behaviour and result in other (e.g., social) consequences will be more sustainable [
