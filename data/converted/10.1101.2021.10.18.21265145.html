  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Little is known about the genetics of norm violation and aggression (ASB) in relation to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To investigate this, we used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies and linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate a matrix of genetic correlations ( r  gs ) for ASB, COVID-19, and various health and behavioral traits. After false-discovery rate correction, ASB was genetically correlated with COVID-19 ( r  g  = 0.51; P = 1.54E-02) and 19 other traits. ASB and COVID-19 were both positively genetically correlated with having a noisy workplace, doing heavy manual labor, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and genitourinary diseases. ASB and COVID-19 were both inversely genetically correlated with average income, education years, healthspan, verbal reasoning, lifespan, cheese intake, and being breastfed as a baby. But keep in mind that r  gs  are not necessarily causal. And, if causal, their prevailing directions of effect (which causes which) are indiscernible from r  gs  alone. Moreover, the SNP-heritability ![Graphic][1]</img> estimates for both measures of COVID-19 were very low, restricting the overlap of genetic variance in absolute terms between the two traits. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that those with antisocial tendencies possibly have a higher risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) than those without antisocial tendencies. This may have been especially true early in the pandemic before vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were available and before the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant.

                             Little is known about the genetics of norm violation and aggression (ASB) in relation to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To investigate this, we used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies and linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate a matrix of genetic correlations (r

ASB and COVID-19 were both positively genetically correlated with having a noisy workplace, doing heavy manual labor, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and genitourinary diseases. ASB and COVID-19 were both inversely genetically correlated with average income, education years, healthspan, verbal reasoning, lifespan, cheese intake, and being breastfed as a baby. But keep in mind that r

                             estimates for both measures of COVID-19 were very low, restricting the overlap of genetic variance in absolute terms between the two traits. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that those with antisocial tendencies possibly have a higher risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) than those without antisocial tendencies. This may have been especially true early in the pandemic before vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were available and before the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant.

Nineteen traits were chosen for novelty (having not been previously reported as either null or significantly correlated with ASB). The novel traits include: average income (before taxes); healthspan (i.e., living free from congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], stroke, dementia, diabetes, cancer, and death; coded as a protective ratio); parental lifespan (hereafter “lifespan”; coded as a protective ratio); word interpolation (hereafter “verbal reasoning”); having been breastfed as baby; cheese intake; self-reported happiness; having had COVID-19 (data from two GWA studies); doing heavy manual labor; having a noisy workplace; Townsend Deprivation Index (an area- and census-based measure of deprivation, where a higher score indicates more deprivation); having gastrointestinal diseases; having COPD; having genitourinary diseases; playing computer games; having been a violent-crime victim; risk tolerance, and witnessing a sudden violent death. Four traits (education years; seen doctor for nerves, anxiety, tension, or depression; neuroticism; and Parkinson’s disease) were chosen as replicates of previously reported findings.

The totality of our data instead suggests that a broad architecture of factors predispose some to both ASB and COVID-19. Traits, for example, that are positively genetically correlated with both ASB and COVID-19—having a noisy workplace, doing heavy manual labor, and having COPD—are also strongly inversely genetically correlated with education years, verbal reasoning, and average income.

Earlier GWA study releases by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative capture data from earlier timepoints in the pandemic—release 4 being earlier (October 20, 2020) than release 6 (June 15, 2021). This may be important since release 4 occurred before vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were available, and by June 15, 2021, 47% of those eligible for vaccination had completed an initial protocol for full vaccination in the U.S.

If those with antisocial tendencies disproportionately refuse vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, however, the impact of ASB over time may have shifted from who gets exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to who gets severe disease.

For much of the discussion above, we tacitly presumed plausible directions of effect (e.g., ASB causing exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and, thus, COVID-19 versus COVID-19 causing ASB). But with all the traits in our matrix, the prevailing direction of effect could be the opposite and/or some level of bi-directional causation may exist

                             models to infer causality between traits or perform bi-directional MR, an instrumental variables technique, for which both directions of effect are probed. Regarding MR, few genome-wide significant signals have been found for ASB, and using SNPs weakly associated with ASB as instrumental variables would violate the assumptions necessary to perform MR. But assuming SNPs strongly associated with ASB are eventually found, bi-directional MR can be used to decipher the prevailing directions of effect between ASB and traits with which it’s associated. A fourth limitation is that our findings are limited to those of European ancestry. The limitations notwithstanding, r

This is a strength of study, which enabled us to capitalize on the power of large, population-based cohorts and publicly available GWA studies to probe timely questions. Finally, working to understand the etiology of ASB gets us closer to thinking about strategies to provide relief to a large part of the global population—both those engaged in ASB and those devastated by it.
