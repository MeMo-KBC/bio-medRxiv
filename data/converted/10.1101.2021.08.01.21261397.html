  <meta name="DC.Description" content="BACKGROUND Reports on medium and long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infections largely lack quantification of incidence and relative risk. We describe the rationale and methods of the Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Registry (INSPIRE) that combines patient-reported outcomes with data from digital health records to understand predictors and impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS INSPIRE is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study of individuals with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in eight regions across the US. Adults are eligible for enrollment if they are fluent in English or Spanish, reported symptoms suggestive of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they are within 42 days of having a SARS-CoV-2 viral test (i.e., nucleic acid amplification test or antigen test), regardless of test results. Recruitment occurs in-person, by phone or email, and through online advertisement. A secure online platform is used to facilitate the collation of consent-related materials, digital health records, and responses to self-administered surveys. Participants are followed for up to 18 months, with patient-reported outcomes collected every three months via survey and linked to concurrent digital health data; follow-up includes no in-person involvement. Our planned enrollment is 4,800 participants, including 2,400 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 2,400 SARS-CoV-2 negative participants (as a concurrent comparison group). These data will allow assessment of longitudinal outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection and comparison of the relative risk of outcomes in individuals with and without infection. Patient-reported outcomes include self-reported health function and status, as well as clinical outcomes including health system encounters and new diagnoses.

RESULTS Participating sites obtained institutional review board approval. Enrollment and follow-up are ongoing.

CONCLUSIONS This study will characterize medium and long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection among a diverse population, predictors of sequelae, and their relative risk compared to persons with similar symptomatology but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data may inform clinical interventions for individuals with sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="BACKGROUND Reports on medium and long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infections largely lack quantification of incidence and relative risk. We describe the rationale and methods of the Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Registry (INSPIRE) that combines patient-reported outcomes with data from digital health records to understand predictors and impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS INSPIRE is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study of individuals with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in eight regions across the US. Adults are eligible for enrollment if they are fluent in English or Spanish, reported symptoms suggestive of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they are within 42 days of having a SARS-CoV-2 viral test (i.e., nucleic acid amplification test or antigen test), regardless of test results. Recruitment occurs in-person, by phone or email, and through online advertisement. A secure online platform is used to facilitate the collation of consent-related materials, digital health records, and responses to self-administered surveys. Participants are followed for up to 18 months, with patient-reported outcomes collected every three months via survey and linked to concurrent digital health data; follow-up includes no in-person involvement. Our planned enrollment is 4,800 participants, including 2,400 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 2,400 SARS-CoV-2 negative participants (as a concurrent comparison group). These data will allow assessment of longitudinal outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection and comparison of the relative risk of outcomes in individuals with and without infection. Patient-reported outcomes include self-reported health function and status, as well as clinical outcomes including health system encounters and new diagnoses.

RESULTS Participating sites obtained institutional review board approval. Enrollment and follow-up are ongoing.

CONCLUSIONS This study will characterize medium and long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection among a diverse population, predictors of sequelae, and their relative risk compared to persons with similar symptomatology but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data may inform clinical interventions for individuals with sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

                              </strong>
                              Reports on medium and long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infections largely lack quantification of incidence and relative risk. We describe the rationale and methods of the Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Registry (INSPIRE) that combines patient-reported outcomes with data from digital health records to understand predictors and impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

                               METHODS
                              </strong>
                              INSPIRE is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study of individuals with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in eight regions across the US. Adults are eligible for enrollment if they are fluent in English or Spanish, reported symptoms suggestive of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they are within 42 days of having a SARS-CoV-2 viral test (i.e., nucleic acid amplification test or antigen test), regardless of test results. Recruitment occurs in-person, by phone or email, and through online advertisement. A secure online platform is used to facilitate the collation of consent-related materials, digital health records, and responses to self-administered surveys. Participants are followed for up to 18 months, with patient-reported outcomes collected every three months via survey and linked to concurrent digital health data; follow-up includes no in-person involvement. Our planned enrollment is 4,800 participants, including 2,400 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 2,400 SARS-CoV-2 negative participants (as a concurrent comparison group). These data will allow assessment of longitudinal outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection and comparison of the relative risk of outcomes in individuals with and without infection. Patient-reported outcomes include self-reported health function and status, as well as clinical outcomes including health system encounters and new diagnoses.

                              </strong>
                              This study will characterize medium and long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection among a diverse population, predictors of sequelae, and their relative risk compared to persons with similar symptomatology but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data may inform clinical interventions for individuals with sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

                             To accelerate research during this critical time in the global COVID-19 pandemic, our research consortium designed a prospective longitudinal study to use patient-reported information linked to real-world data through the Innovative Support for Patients With SARS-COV2 Infections Registry (INSPIRE) hosted on a secure online platform (Hugo, Hugo Health LLC, Guilford, CT) which imports health information from various sources with permission from participants. In this study, researchers follow a sample of individuals under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 over time, to collect patient-reported outcomes, interactions with the medical system (i.e., clinic visits, hospitalizations, laboratory test and medications prescribed) and outcomes of care as reported in the electronic medical record (EMR). The goals of this research are to understand the medium- and long-term sequelae of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, to describe predictors of sequelae as reported by individuals and as recorded in their EMR, and to assess the intersection of long-term sequelae of COVID-19 with other previously defined syndromes with overlapping features such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

Efforts are made to recruit participants from across the spectrum of COVID-19 illness severity, including individuals from outpatient (e.g., drive through testing with self-reported symptoms) to inpatient settings, and those cared for in intensive care units. We initially used a 3:1 case/control enrollment ratio to oversample those who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 on testing, while still ensuring an adequate control cohort for comparison. However, given the heterogeneity in baseline characteristics among study subjects, we modified the enrollment to support a 1:1 case/control ratio, which will better enable the comparison of ‘ like’ cases with ‘ like’ controls.

We seek to enroll participants as close to their initial date of SARS-CoV-2 testing as possible in order to reduce recall bias. Participant identification and recruitment methods include: i) participants learn of the study from a poster, brochure, or social media advertisement and/or ii) research staff identify potentially eligible individuals and reach out to them in-person, over the phone (e.g., text or call), or by e-mail to invite them to enroll. In some instances, members of the study team access the EMR to screen for eligible individuals based on SARS-CoV-2 testing and reason for testing. In other cases, contact information are obtained from organizations conducting SARS-CoV-2 testing. The recruitment methods used at each site are based on local IRB approval and practical considerations. Regardless of how the individual is recruited, all participants must enroll through the online portal. Individuals may access this portal through any device that connects to the internet (e.g., smart phone, tablet, computer).

The Hugo platform gives patients the ability to collect and maintain their personal health records in a centralized, cloud-based account. Participants create a Hugo account and connect the health system portal accounts they choose to connect with the Hugo platform. This may include patient portals from healthcare systems, pharmacies, laboratories, and insurers. Individuals direct Hugo to share their health records with the research team according to the terms in the informed consent. This information is sent from Hugo to the research analytic core and stored in accordance with their institutional policies. The specific portal-related information available through Hugo in use for INSPIRE includes all data available through the patient portal, including medications, appointments and visits, test orders and results, clinical notes, problems, diagnoses, vital signs, demographics, and immunizations. After the study, participants can maintain their Hugo account or opt to delete their account and data.

                              Our target enrollment at study initiation was 3,600 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test (i.e., nucleic acid amplification test or antigen test) and 1,200 people with a negative SARS-CoV-2 viral test. We expect that the age distribution of enrolled subjects will be broadly representative of patients tested in each site. Four of the sites (Yale, Jefferson, Rush and UW) draw on smaller catchment populations so have planned enrollment of 400 subjects per site. Four sites (UT Southwestern, UT Houston, University of California, San Francisco, and University of California, Los Angeles) have larger catchment populations so have planned enrollment of 800 subjects per site. Due to heterogeneity in baseline characteristics among study subjects identified early in the study, we modified the enrollment to support a 1:1 case/control ratio at each site, to better enable the comparison of ‘ like’ cases with ‘ like’ controls.

                              We estimated the power to detect relative differences in outcome rates between those who are symptomatic and test positive for SARS-CoV-2 as compared to those who are symptomatic but test negative for SARS-CoV-2. These power calculations are agnostic to the outcome of interest but based on the aim to examine relative differences in long-term outcomes between individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2 based on and between age strata. Prior to changing the enrollment strategy to a 1:1 case/control ratio, we reran the power analysis. These findings showed that with 1:1 enrollment, we had increased power to find a difference between SARS-CoV-2 infected vs. uninfected participants. For comparison of ME/CFS incidence in SARS-CoV-2 infected vs. uninfected, power calculations are based on the null hypothesis that there is no difference between individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2 in the outcome rate.

The power to detect a relative difference in outcome rates is highly sensitive to both the actual baseline outcome rate as well as variation in baseline outcome rates between age strata. The study would have adequate power (conventionally defined as 0.8) to detect a difference as small as 5% in outcomes with 1,224 total participants (25.5% of total planned enrollment) enrolled in a 3:1 ratio, or 918 COVID+ and 306 COVID negative (

                              To date, there has been a relative lack of epidemiological studies designed to provide robust evidence of incidence, risk factors, and natural history of sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Existing studies are limited by multiple potential biases in study design. Many prior studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection recruited from single rather than multiple centers, which may overestimate the relationship between baseline factors as well as treatment exposures and outcome and thereby lack generalizability [

In addition, many have preferentially recruited patients who are hospitalized or receive intensive care, who have greater acuity or severity of illness and could be at greater risk of long-term sequelae than those who are treated in an ambulatory setting. In contrast, our recruitment of participants testing for SARS-CoV-2 with acute symptoms of illness from community (e.g. drive up testing sites), clinic, emergency, and in-patient settings reduces the likelihood of selection bias [

Of note, a considerable proportion of those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop new clinical sequelae that were not present during the acute illness and that require medical attention; new clinical sequelae include chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia, diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety and fatigue [

There remains uncertainty regarding the incidence of sequelae, the range of impacts on individuals, the factors associated with risk for development of sequelae, and the natural history/time course of the sequelae. Given the high global rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, this information is critical to guide care following SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst vast numbers of individuals. This evidence could potentially highlight individuals at higher risk for complications who may require more intensive follow-up and facilitate earlier intervention and guide targeting of primary or secondary interventions [

                              Our cohort study integrates detailed self-reports of participants with automated capture of their EHR information to provide more comprehensive data than traditional approaches. This innovative method enables capturing of baseline medical conditions, accounting for intermediate events between SARS-CoV-2 infection and sequelae, and objective assessments over time. Merging self-reported and digital data in this manner paves the way for similar research into long-term sequelae in other disease entities, including non-infectious illnesses such as trauma. Using the on-line digital platform to collect patient-oriented outcomes enables us to adapt the survey content in real time as new information emerges. For example, we adapted the survey when vaccines became available. Additionally, there is the potential for this cohort to be engaged in future research as new questions arise relating to long-term sequalae, therapies and other related issues. Recruitment design strengths include the inclusion of participants with a range of disease severity, including participants with and without a history of hospitalization. Additionally, we seek to recruit participants who are ethnically diverse and geographically dispersed. Further, our design includes concurrent controls with negative SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic results to overcome the variable exposure to healthcare access as well as to COVID-19 mitigation strategies implemented in the community (e.g., masking mandates, shut-downs) which could otherwise bias assessment of the risk of patient-reported outcomes. Finally, our planned sample size will enable detection of rare events among the study population.

                              Our design anticipates and addresses study limitations as feasible. First, inclusion in the INSPIRE study requires participants to have a sufficient degree of technology literacy as well as periodic access to the internet which may introduce selection bias into who is able to participate. There are large differences in the use of desktop or laptop computers between Black (58%) or Hispanic or Latino persons (57%) vs. White (82%) individuals [
                              <a id="xref-ref-64-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-64">
                               64

                              ]. Importantly, about 80% of Black, Hispanic or Latino persons, and White adults own a smartphone; lack of availability of a smartphone should not be a barrier to enrollment of racial/ethnic subgroups in this study. We worked to overcome challenges related to technology literacy by offering support at the time of enrollment and throughout the study to troubleshoot problems such as linking digital health portals to the Hugo platform and completing quarterly surveys. Second, while medium and long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection can occur following asymptomatic infection, we made the decision not to enroll asymptomatic individuals and thus will not be able to report on outcomes in this group. We anticipate that individuals with COVID-19 and symptomatic illness are more likely to have the outcomes of interest. Third, there is the potential for selection bias in which participants whose COVID-19 illness has not yet resolved are more likely to enroll in this study. To mitigate against this, we required that enrollment occurwithin 42 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. At the analysis stage, sensitivity analysis can describe long-term symptoms as a function of time between onset and enrollment.
                             </p>
                             <p id="p-74">
                              Fourth, given the prospective longitudinal design of this study, there is an inherent risk of attrition and loss-to-follow-up of participants. To limit this potential problem, each research site monitors research participants’ progress and invites them to re-engage if they do not complete their quarterly survey. While the preferred means of contact varies between sites, this may include through email, short message service (i.e., text), or telephone reminder. Additionally, participants are incentivized to participate with a monetary reward for survey completion as described above (consent and ethics section).

                              Fifth, there is a risk of poor data quality and misclassification. With this study design which incorporates digital health data, some data is passively acquired and thereby data quality is dependent on the linkage to and capture of electronic medical records. We believe that coupling these digital health data with the self-reported data will enhance the accuracy and completeness of available information. There is also potential for bias from unmasking underlying health conditions identified during the study that were not known until after the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in misclassification of pre-existing diagnoses as sequelae of COVID-19. As feasible, we will evaluate indications of undiagnosed health conditions by evaluating data from the EHR.

Participants with false negative test results are classified as controls but can still have increased risks of long-term sequelae, which may bias our results towards the null. As well, participants’ SARS-CoV-2 status can change over time due to repeat exposure and repeat diagnostic testing. We inquire about repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing and results during quarterly surveys and we will also look for related data during electronic medical record review.

                              Upon the conclusion of the study, we will be able to quantify the burden of long-term SARS-CoV-2 sequelae as well as characterize predictors of sequelae. Additionally, data from INSPIRE will offer insight into syndromes with overlapping signs and symptoms, such as ME/CFS, as well as how people with underlying disease and subsequent COVID-19 experience these illnesses. We will be better poised to develop prevention and treatment strategies and to tailor these strategies for the most at-risk subsets of the population. The results will inform clinicians and public health authorities and will help prepare for future SARS-CoV-2 surges.
