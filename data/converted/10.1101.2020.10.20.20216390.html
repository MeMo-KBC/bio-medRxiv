This systematic review examines this literature to clarify its clinical significance and to assess the implications of the various analytic methods applied. We found that, although most of studies reported the classification accuracies, they varied in choice of MRI modalities, ML models, cross-validation and testing methods, and sample sizes. We found that the accuracies of cross-validation methods inflated the performance estimation compared with those of a held-out test, compromising the model generalizability. Test accuracies have increased with publication year but were not associated with training sample sizes. Improved test accuracy over time was likely due to the use of better ML methods along with strategies to deal with data imbalances. Ultimately, large multi-modal imaging datasets, and potentially the combination with other types of data, like cognitive data and/or genetics, will be essential to achieve the goal of developing clinically useful imaging classification tools for ADHD in the future.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Machine learning (ML) has been applied to develop magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based diagnostic classifiers for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This systematic review examines this literature to clarify its clinical significance and to assess the implications of the various analytic methods applied. We found that, although most of studies reported the classification accuracies, they varied in choice of MRI modalities, ML models, cross-validation and testing methods, and sample sizes. We found that the accuracies of cross-validation methods inflated the performance estimation compared with those of a held-out test, compromising the model generalizability. Test accuracies have increased with publication year but were not associated with training sample sizes. Improved test accuracy over time was likely due to the use of better ML methods along with strategies to deal with data imbalances. Ultimately, large multi-modal imaging datasets, and potentially the combination with other types of data, like cognitive data and/or genetics, will be essential to achieve the goal of developing clinically useful imaging classification tools for ADHD in the future.

                             Machine learning (ML) has been applied to develop magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based diagnostic classifiers for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This systematic review examines this literature to clarify its clinical significance and to assess the implications of the various analytic methods applied. We found that, although most of studies reported the classification accuracies, they varied in choice of MRI modalities, ML models, cross-validation and testing methods, and sample sizes. We found that the accuracies of cross-validation methods inflated the performance estimation compared with those of a held-out test, compromising the model generalizability. Test accuracies have increased with publication year but were not associated with training sample sizes. Improved test accuracy over time was likely due to the use of better ML methods along with strategies to deal with data imbalances. Ultimately, large multi-modal imaging datasets, and potentially the combination with other types of data, like cognitive data and/or genetics, will be essential to achieve the goal of developing clinically useful imaging classification tools for ADHD in the future.

                             Clinicians diagnose ADHD by evaluating symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and impaired functioning across settings. The diagnosis of ADHD shows considerable levels of concurrent and predictive validity in its clinical features, course, neurobiology, and treatment response [

                             ]. Nevertheless, concerns about diagnostic accuracy persist. Some suggest that the current method of diagnosing ADHD is too subjective and leads to over-diagnosing ADHD in the community [

                             ]. Psychiatric diagnoses have been called “subjective” because they rely on clinician evaluation of responses from patients, parents, and/or informants. Other studies have raised concerns about the under-diagnosis of ADHD [

                             ], especially in girls and women, which suggests biases in applying the current diagnostic algorithm. Another issue is the misdiagnosis of ADHD as being another disorder. When this occurs, patients may be exposed to unnecessary treatments and will continue to struggle with the many impairments associated with ADHD. Those who have ADHD and are not diagnosed with the disorder will continue to have impaired functioning leading to increased risks for other health and social problems [

                             In response to these concerns, researchers have sought to develop objective measures to diagnose ADHD or to monitor the course of ADHD symptoms during treatment. Much research has examined peripheral biochemical markers in differentiating ADHD and control patients, such as (Norepinephrine (NE), 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MHPG), monoamine oxidase (MAO), zinc, and cortisol [

Zhu and colleagues’ discriminant analysis classifier assessed 9 ADHD and 11 typically developing boys. Although high predictive accuracies were reported in these studies (85∼ 87%), it is difficult to evaluate how well those models would generalize given the small samples and lack of replication samples.

It provided a dataset of 776 children, adolescents and young adults (7-21 years old, 63% healthy controls, 37% ADHD) from eight sites. Fifty teams from around the world joined the competition with 21 final submissions. Machine learning models predominated. Due to the large sample size, the consortium was able to set aside a test set that was not used for model selection and development. The competition results were judged by the performance on the test set only. This contrasts with previous studies with small sample sizes, where a held-out test set was not available. The ADHD-200 winning team used an ensemble model which achieved a 61% accuracy with 21% sensitivity and 94% specificity using both structural and resting state-fMRI data along with the demographic predictors [

We assigned studies with a training set class ratio between 0.4 ∼0.6 as “balanced” (i.e., nearly equal), and those with higher or lower ratios as “unbalanced”. Nine studies used various methods to balance demographic differences between the ADHD and control groups.

The held-out test set method evaluates model performance on data that were set aside, i.e., they were not used during model estimation and training. Because this method requires a large sample, many studies resort to cross-validation (CV) method to assess model performance. CV methods randomly re-sample examples to be set aside during model fitting. The most commonly used versions are the leave-one-out CV (LOOCV) [46, 47, 52-54] and K-Fold-CV (where K is often = 10, 5, or 2) [

                             ]. For example, in 10-fold CV, the original dataset is partitioned into 10 equal sub-samples or “folds”. For each iteration of model estimation nine of the subsamples are used to estimate model parameters and the left-out fold is used to estimate model accuracy. The left-out fold changes from iteration to iteration. For LOOCV, one sample is left out for testing while all the others are used for training or model fitting. In either situation, the process is repeated until all samples have been used in both the training and test sets. The CV accuracy is estimated by averaging over all iterations of CV accuracies. Although CV samples were not used during the model training/fitting at each iteration, they are, nevertheless, used as training examples in other iterations.

We performed the variable selection and linear regression modeling for all the studies combined, as well as separately for the K-Fold-CV, LOOCV, and held-out test groups. Training sample size was primarily examined as a continuous variable. However, we also classified sample sizes as small (<300) or large (>300) to compare the variability of their accuracy estimates using Levene’ s robust test statistic [

                             Our quantitative analysis of prediction accuracy for ADHD revealed several significant findings. First, accuracies based on K-Fold-CV or LOOCV were significantly higher than those reported using held-out tests, which suggests that CV methods may over-estimate model performance. Second, we found greater variability of test accuracies reported in studies with small sample sizes than those of larger sample sizes and an inverse relationship of sample size and K-Fold-CV accuracies. Third, estimates of accuracy increased with publication year. This was driven primarily by the Hold-out and the LOOCV test-groups. Since sample size has been roughly the same since 2012, with the exception of a 2021 study [

                             ], the increasing accuracy over time could be due to several design features: 1) the use of more sophisticated models (such as deep neural networks and CNN models), 2) improved methods of data balancing and data augmentation, and 3) use of feature selection, feature space reduction methods or different MRI data modalities. However, our analysis cannot conclusively clarify if any or all of above attributed to the increase of accuracies. We discuss the implications of these findings and provide further review of some study characteristics that were not examined in our quantitative analysis.

                              In the CV approach, the validation samples used to estimate accuracy are not used during the model training/fitting at each iteration. They are, nevertheless, used as training examples in other iterations. Moreover, because there are many iterations, the validation set can influence parameter estimates. In contrast, the held-out test method uses a test set that was never used during model training. As a result, CV accuracies have been shown to overestimate test set accuracy when both are available [

However, many neuroimaging studies of ADHD used very small sample sizes. In our small sample group, the sample size ranged from 20 to 239 (average sample size 112). Small sample sizes can lead to model overfitting and overestimates of accuracy [

Indeed, some of the highest and lowest test accuracies were reported in studies with extremely small sample sizes. None of the studies reviewed here used a learning curve analysis to assess overfitting. This method, which examines the relationship of model performance over various numbers of training sample sizes, can help us to determine if a model is overfit and if it can benefit from more training examples [

                              Although collaborative consortia, such as the ADHD-200, used relatively large samples sizes, such collaborations raise issues about sample heterogeneity and the use of imbalanced data. For example, like many other clinically referred samples, the ADHD-200 dataset had more boys than girls in the ADHD group compared with the control group. The ADHD group also had lower IQs than the control group. In addition, the demographic composition and sample acquisition methods differed across different study sites. The problem of dataset imbalance was addressed by several participating teams. Brown and colleagues from the University of Alberta found that models using only demographic information including age, sex, handedness, and IQ had sufficient statistical power to achieve a test accuracy 62.5%, higher than their models using fMRI features [

Balanced studies in the K-Fold-CV group reported higher accuracies than those with unbalanced samples. However, they were mostly smaller studies than the unbalanced studies. It is not clear, at least for the K-Fold-CV group, if balanced designs led to higher accuracies, because sample size was a strong and negative predictor for the accuracies. Moreover, higher accuracies in the balanced LOOCV group were dependent on sample size (only significant for large studies with over 300 participants). This suggests that sample balancing may help performance in cases of large heterogenous studies. As expected, the results indicate that small sample sizes are not compensated by data balancing. More studies and larger sample sizes will be needed to find the appropriate class balancing methods and assess the potential benefit.

                              When test sets (or cross-validation sets) are also imbalanced, the overall accuracy may not be an ideal indicator of the performance of the classifier. A high accuracy can simply result from a classifier that classifies all samples into the class that has more participants. Most studies (N= 36, 75%) addressed this concern by also reporting sensitivity (True Positive rate, TP, the percentage of correctly identified cases (ADHD)) and specificity (True Negative rate, TN, the percentage of correctly identified controls). Three studies reported balanced accuracy, which is the arithmetic mean of the sensitivity and specificity; and three studies reported Youden’ s J-statistic (sensitivity + specificity -1).

The area under the ROC (AUC) measures the overall diagnostic accuracy of a classifier. Higher AUCs indicate better discriminating power (with 1 for the perfect classifier and 0.5 for the random non-discriminative classifier). The AUC is in general less sensitive to imbalance of a dataset compared with the percent correct measure, because AUC does not have bias toward models that perform well on the majority class at the expense of the minority class [

The AUPRC plots precision (the percentage of examples classified as positive that are true positive, also known as positive predictive value, PPV) over recall (sensitivity). Overall, in the body of literature that we examined, no studies reported the AUPRC, and only 13 reported the AUC.

                              Other popular metrics for machine learning models are F1-score and Matthew’ s correlation coefficient (MCC). The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. MCC is the correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual classes. Like the areas under the PRC or ROC, both the F1-score and MCC are better indicators of model performance than the percent correct statistic if test data classes are imbalanced. However, of the studies included in this review, only three reported F1-scores, and only two reported MCC.

                              Because most studies used percent correct to measures accuracy, we could only analyze percent correct in the current review. This may not represent the true model performance due to the limitations of this metric. We recommend that future studies adopt ROC or PRC analysis methods. Furthermore, inspecting the curves visually can reveal more information about how well the model discriminate classes at different decision thresholds. We don’ t recommend metrics such as the F1-score, MCC, and J-statistics, because these scores only capture the diagnostic matrix at a single threshold level. Furthermore, the performance metrics are important, not only for properly interpreting test results, but also for model training. If a model was trained by maximizing a biased metric, it will not be fully optimized to generalize to other samples. Finally, metrics that are insensitive to class imbalance (such as AUC or AUPRC) do not protect against biased due to feature imbalance as discussed in the prior section.

As a result, although the majority of the studies included samples from the both males and females, a high percentage of ADHD samples were from males (i.e., ∼80% male in ADHD-200 dataset). However, the control samples were often balanced (i.e., 52% male in ADHD-200 dataset). If sex is left unbalanced, it could result in erroneous prediction results, as we described in the above sections. Furthermore, brain alterations have been found to differ between the sexes at different ages [

Our quantitative analysis showed significantly higher accuracies in four male-only studies than other studies of sex-mixed samples. However, all four were studies with small sample sizes (<189), with three reporting LOOCV accuracies and the other reporting 10-Fold CV. Given the sample size effect and inflation by CV methods, it is inconclusive if ML models predict ADHD better in boys than girls.

SVM, however, is limited in handling images and relies on other preprocessing methods to extract a tabular representation of three-dimensional brain images. In more recent years, an increasing number of studies have used neurol networks [50, 51, 64, 88-90], particularly CNNs, which were developed for image analysis. We did not, however, observe statistically significant differences between the accuracies of the SVM and CNN models for ADHD. This finding is limited by the small number of studies using CNN classifiers. Nevertheless, because the use of CNNs will likely increase in the future, we here describe their current contributions to the field and their potential for the future.

The classifier achieved a highest held-out test accuracy of 68.6% for the ADHD-200 Peking subset.

Mao and colleagues argued that rather than using hand-crafted features, one should use a CNN to directly learn discriminatory features from images. Their four-dimensional CNN classifier, designed to learn and extract spatial and temporal features from rs-fMRI images, discriminated ADHD from control participants with an accuracy of 71.3% [

Despite their promising results, they acknowledged that much work is still needed to localize the most discriminative sequences. Interestingly, a CNN using activation correlations from individual brain regions of the Default Mode Network (DMN) of the brain outperformed those using whole brain features [

                              Sample size has been a major bottleneck impeding the development of more accurate and clinically useful imaging classifiers for ADHD. The largest MRI dataset, to date, has been built by the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics Through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium. Under the umbrella of the ENIGMA consortium, many independent working groups for specific diseases or phenotypes have been established, including ADHD. By implementing standardized data processing protocols and pipelines, the ENIGMA consortium made it possible to share data across many sites to perform within-disorder and cross-disorder studies [

Users of the ENIGMA ADHD dataset, however, face the same problems of data heterogeneity and imbalanced demographic groups as those using the ADHD-200 dataset. Significant challenges remain when using such data to build a machine learning classifier. Furthermore, the ENIGMA ADHD data is primarily preprocessed sMRI data in tabular form. Not all sites have data on other modalities, such as rs-fMRI or DTI, available for their samples. The ENIGMA ADHD sites have not yet pooled raw MRI images, which is needed for CNN models. Nevertheless, we encourage the research community to continue to contribute ADHD samples to this cohort and provide more open access to various data modalities. Future studies that attempt to advance ML-powered ADHD diagnostic classifiers should use the ENIGMA ADHD dataset available, as this resource has been under-utilized in AI and ML studies of ADHD.

                             Our review of ML studies of MRI-based ADHD diagnostic classifiers has important implications for methods development, but these studies have not yet led to clinically useful classifiers. Our review shows that the variability of results across studies is due, in part, to differences in methodology. Future work should use the largest samples possible and should rely on a held-out test set, rather than cross-validation for estimating prediction accuracy. Future studies should not rely on percent correct as a measure of accuracy in unbalanced samples. Our analysis also highlighted the need of data from underrepresented groups, particularly females and adults. We hope that our review provides a better understanding of the efforts invested in developing ADHD imaging classifiers in the field and encourages more stringent model design and data processing for future studies. In the meanwhile, the initial results from the ENIGMA ADHD consortium should encourage more sites to participate. The lack of a very large multi-modal dataset that include sufficient data from both sex and all ages may be the biggest impediment to developing a clinically useful classifier for diagnosing ADHD.
