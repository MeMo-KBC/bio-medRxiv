  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Cognitive impairment experienced by people with bipolar disorders (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impaired psychosocial function and poorer quality of life. Sleep disturbance is another core symptom of mood disorders which may be associated with, and perhaps worsen, cognitive impairments. The aim of this systematic review was to critically assess the relationship between sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in mood disorders.

Methods In this systematic review, relevant studies were identified using electronic database searches of PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science.

Findings Fourteen studies were included; eight investigated people with BD, five investigated people with MDD, and one included both people with MDD and people with BD. One study was an intervention for sleep disturbance and the remaining thirteen studies used either a longitudinal or cross-sectional observational design. Ten studies reported a significant association between subjectively measured sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in people with MDD or BD after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, whereas no such association was found in healthy participants. Two studies reported a significant association between objectively measured sleep abnormalities and cognitive impairment in mood disorders. One study of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia modified for BD (CBTI-BD) found an association between improvements in sleep and cognitive performance in BD.

Interpretation There is preliminary evidence to suggest a significant association between sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in mood disorders. These findings suggest that identifying and treating sleep disturbance may be important when addressing cognitive impairment in mood disorders.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background Cognitive impairment experienced by people with bipolar disorders (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impaired psychosocial function and poorer quality of life. Sleep disturbance is another core symptom of mood disorders which may be associated with, and perhaps worsen, cognitive impairments. The aim of this systematic review was to critically assess the relationship between sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in mood disorders.

Methods In this systematic review, relevant studies were identified using electronic database searches of PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science.

Findings Fourteen studies were included; eight investigated people with BD, five investigated people with MDD, and one included both people with MDD and people with BD. One study was an intervention for sleep disturbance and the remaining thirteen studies used either a longitudinal or cross-sectional observational design. Ten studies reported a significant association between subjectively measured sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in people with MDD or BD after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, whereas no such association was found in healthy participants. Two studies reported a significant association between objectively measured sleep abnormalities and cognitive impairment in mood disorders. One study of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia modified for BD (CBTI-BD) found an association between improvements in sleep and cognitive performance in BD.

Interpretation There is preliminary evidence to suggest a significant association between sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in mood disorders. These findings suggest that identifying and treating sleep disturbance may be important when addressing cognitive impairment in mood disorders.

                              Cognitive impairment experienced by people with bipolar disorders (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impaired psychosocial function and poorer quality of life. Sleep disturbance is another core symptom of mood disorders which may be associated with, and perhaps worsen, cognitive impairments. The aim of this systematic review was to critically assess the relationship between sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in mood disorders.

                              </strong>
                              Fourteen studies were included; eight investigated people with BD, five investigated people with MDD, and one included both people with MDD and people with BD. One study was an intervention for sleep disturbance and the remaining thirteen studies used either a longitudinal or cross-sectional observational design. Ten studies reported a significant association between subjectively measured sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in people with MDD or BD after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, whereas no such association was found in healthy participants. Two studies reported a significant association between objectively measured sleep abnormalities and cognitive impairment in mood disorders. One study of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia modified for BD (CBTI-BD) found an association between improvements in sleep and cognitive performance in BD.

                              There is preliminary evidence to suggest a significant association between sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in mood disorders. These findings suggest that identifying and treating sleep disturbance may be important when addressing cognitive impairment in mood disorders.

                             ), and determining how cognitive impairment is mediated in MDD and BD is a key priority. Sleep disturbance may be one contributing factor. Sleep disturbances are core features of manic episodes, hypomanic episodes and major depressive episodes manifesting as insomnia or hypersomnia and fatigue in major depressive episodes and a decreased need for sleep in manic or hypomanic episodes (

                             ). There is also growing evidence to suggest that sleep disturbance persists during euthymia in a substantial proportion of people with mood disorders. Clinically significant sleep disturbances are reported by 70% of euthymic people with BD (

The study also found that a reduction in sleep time variability predicted improved verbal learning. These findings suggest that sleep disturbance may contribute to cognitive impairment in BD, and that CBTI-BD may be an effective treatment. The remaining studies included in our review used either a longitudinal or cross-sectional design, and therefore did not allow for causal inferences to be made.

                             Ten of the twelve studies that measured sleep disturbance using subjective measures in participants with either MDD or BD found a significant association between sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment when adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. In contrast, no significant association was reported in healthy participants, which suggests that this relationship may be specific to mood disorders. Given the strong evidence on the effect of objective sleep disturbance on cognitive impairment in healthy individuals (

                             ), this may indicate that subjective experience of sleep impairment may also increase risks for cognitive impairment in people with mood disorders. Some studies also found a curvilinear association, indicating that both extremely low (<5 hours) and extremely high (>11 hours) self-reported sleep durations were associated with cognitive impairment; this was observed in participants with MDD (e.g.

                             The main disadvantage of using subjective measures to assess sleep disturbance in people with mood disorders is that there is a considerable risk of bias. Euthymic people with either BD or MDD tend to significantly underestimate sleep duration and quality (

This effect may be due to maladaptive sleep-related beliefs developed during mood episodes, in which sleep disturbance is particularly severe, which are then carried over into euthymia (

                             ). Nevertheless, subjective measures provide valuable information about the perception of sleep disturbance and sleep-related cognitions, and interventions of maladaptive sleep beliefs may be a useful way of treating sleep disturbance in mood disorders (

                             ), Cognitive Behavioural Treatment for Insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to significantly improve maladaptive sleep beliefs in people with insomnia. CBT-I has been found to significantly improve both subjective sleep measures, measured by sleep diaries, and objective sleep measures, measured by polysomnography (PSG) (

                             ). The MDD study that used PSG found that longer periods of wakefulness occurring after defined sleep onset were associated with psychomotor slowing, however these associations were not specific to MDD (

                             ). One advantage of PSG is that it is more accurate than actigraphy in recognising sleep and wake times, and is therefore the ‘gold standard’ of objective sleep measurement. Another key advantage of PSG is the ability to measure sleep architecture, however,

                             Mood disorders are associated with several sleep architecture abnormalities, particularly altered distribution of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in MDD (

                             ). Components of sleep architecture have been linked to aspects of cognitive impairment in healthy individuals. For example, time in slow wave sleep contributes to processing speed in healthy individuals (

                             ). Abnormal sleep architecture may be associated with cognitive impairment in mood disorders, so sleep architecture may be a highly relevant variable to measure. Moreover, knowledge of the specific components of sleep archiecture associated with improvements in mental health or cognition could be targeted in interventions for treatment or prevention. For example, enhancing slow oscillation activity via non-invasive auditory stimulation has been shown to improve memory in healthy individuals (
                             <a id="xref-ref-50-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-50">

                             ). Thus, we suggest that future studies of the role of sleep in cognition in mood disorders use PSG where possible. It is worth noting that there is a well-known ‘first night effect’ in PSG, characterised by decreased total sleep time, decreased sleep efficiency and reduction of REM sleep on the first night of measurement (

                              This review reflects the limited number of studies in the field and so the relatively small number of participants in which the associations between sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment have been investigated, particularly regarding MDD, limits our power to draw wider conclusions. The studies included in our review generally had small sample sizes (N = 48 - 4555), which limited statistical power and increased risks of type-II error. A meta-analysis was not performed because there was significant heterogeneity between studies in the age and mood state of participants, as well as the measures of sleep and cognition used.

                              Theoretically, sleep disturbance may cause, predispose or exacerbate cognitive impairment in mood disorders but this link has yet to be conclusively evaluated. Further research is clearly needed in this area in participants with mood disorders. Based on the evaluation of current evidence, we would suggest that future studies follow five recommendations. First, studies should include only euthymic participants, to remove the confounding effect of mood state. Second, they should use objective measures of sleep, ideally PSG, to evaluate the role of sleep disturbance in mediating cognitive impairment, and to determine which aspects of sleep architecture are linked to cognition in these individuals. Third, all studies should use a comprehensive cognitive battery such as the BACS-A (

                              ). Fourth, analyses should adjust for the use of psychotropic medications, as these may also have a confounding effect. Finally, we would suggest that studies use a prospective longitudinal design, and, if possible, use a randomised clinical trial design for intervention studies.

                              In conclusion, our systematic review provides preliminary evidence for an association between sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in mood disorders. The studies identified by this systematic review found increased rates of both subjective sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment in people with MDD and BD, compared to healthy participants. Ten of the twelve studies that measured sleep disturbance using subjective measures of sleep found a significant association between sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment across both diagnoses when adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, whereas no significant association was found in healthy participants. In contrast, the evidence was scarcer and more conflicting with regards to whether objectively measured sleep abnormalities are associated with cognitive impairment in people with mood disorders: two out of three studies reported significant associations. Only one study (

                              ) conducted an intervention, and reported that improved sleep predicted an improvement in cognition in BD. As cognitive impairment has significant implications for psychosocial functioning in people with mood disorders, these findings highlight the importance of effectively identifying and treating sleep disturbances in people with MDD and BD.
