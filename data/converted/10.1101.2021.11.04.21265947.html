  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Objective We examined whether teleworking preference and frequency were associated with work functioning impairment.

Methods This online cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire among 27,036 full-time Japanese workers. The Work Functioning Impairment Scale was used to measure work functioning impairment, and we performed multilevel logistic regression analysis.

Results Higher odds ratios for work functioning impairment were observed among employees who preferred to telework compared with those who preferred working in the workplace. A similar trend was observed among employees who teleworked 4 or more days a week compared with those who almost never teleworked. When teleworking preference and frequency were adjusted, only teleworking preference was associated with work functioning impairment.

Conclusions A preference for teleworking was associated with work functioning impairment and one factor that increased the teleworking frequency.

                              Higher odds ratios for work functioning impairment were observed among employees who preferred to telework compared with those who preferred working in the workplace. A similar trend was observed among employees who teleworked 4 or more days a week compared with those who almost never teleworked. When teleworking preference and frequency were adjusted, only teleworking preference was associated with work functioning impairment.

                             Telework involves working at a location other than a central office or workplace, such as at home. Individuals work separately from other employees during working time and use information and communications technology to interact with coworkers, as needed.

                             Teleworking is considered to have both positive and negative effects on workers’ health. Teleworking is characterized by the absence of commuting time and flexibility regarding working location and time. However, teleworking also involves a lack of supervision by superiors, sitting and working at home for long periods, and little communication with colleagues.

                             The positive effects of teleworking on workers include the reduction in commuting time, which allows for more sleep, fewer interruptions from colleagues at work, and greater flexibility in how employees use their time to improve their work–life balance.

                             It is not known how teleworking affects work functioning impairment. In particular, the rapid introduction of teleworking during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic may have created a mismatch between workers’ preferences and teleworking practices. This rapid introduction of teleworking differed from teleworking before the COVID-19 pandemic because workers could not choose to work remotely at will. The option of teleworking was previously selected according to workers’ preferences; however, teleworking during the COVID-19 pandemic was imposed owing to safety and social requirements, regardless of workers’ preferences. Imposing shift work on workers who do not prefer shift work is associated with distress and burnout.

Stratified sampling was conducted by region (five regions according to the regional COVID-19 incidence level), sex (male/female), and job type (office worker/non-office worker). National statistics were used to obtain the regional COVID-19 incidence level during the study period.

                              A WFun score of 21 was used as the cutoff value. Scores above 21 were dichotomized as work functioning impairment and scores below 21 as no work functioning impairment. For teleworking frequency, “once a week” was included in “more than once a month and less than once a week” owing to the small number of respondents. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship of teleworking preference and frequency with WFun score. The hierarchical structure nested in the prefecture of residence according to the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each prefecture was adjusted to account for the effects of intraclass correlation. The associations between teleworking and work functioning impairment were evaluated using three models: an age- and sex-adjusted model, Model 1, and Model 2. In Model 1, we adjusted for sex, age, marital status, annual equivalent household income, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, job type, number of employees, and COVID-19 incidence rate. Model 2 was adjusted for teleworking preferences and teleworking frequency, in addition to those factors adjusted in Model 1. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata/SE 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Approximately three-quarters (72.9%) had a technical college, junior college, university, or graduate degree. Most respondents (78.7%) reported nearly no teleworking; 10.3% of respondents reported very frequent (4 or more days a week) teleworking. Respondents who reported nearly no teleworking had the lowest percentage (22.1%) of high WFun scores. There were no missing data because the survey system was designed to ensure that all questions were answered.

                             shows the association of work functioning impairment with teleworking preference and frequency. In the age- and sex-adjusted model, strong preference for teleworking was associated with work functioning impairment (odds ratio [OR]: 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.90–2.28). The same trend was observed for Model 1, which was adjusted for socioeconomic and lifestyle factors (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 2.01–2.42) and Model 2, which was adjusted for socioeconomic and lifestyle factors and teleworking frequency (OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 2.05–2.51), with participants who prefer teleworking as much as possible associated with work functioning impairment. In the age- and sex-adjusted model, the OR of work functioning impairment was significantly higher among participants who teleworked 4 or more days a week than workers who almost never teleworked (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07–1.3). In Model 1, adjusted for socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, the OR of work functioning impairment was significantly higher among employees who teleworked 4 or more days a week (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.18–1.46) and those who teleworked 2 or 3 days a week (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.12–1.46) compared with those who almost never teleworked. In Model 2, adjusted for teleworking preference in addition to socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, the ORs of work functioning impairment were no longer significantly different among workers who teleworked 4 or more days a week (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.01) and those who teleworked 2 or 3 days a week (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.88–1.16).

                             In this study, we found an association between teleworking frequency and increased work functioning impairment. Additionally, workers who preferred teleworking experienced increased work functioning impairment. When teleworking preference and frequency were adjusted for, only teleworking preference was associated with work functioning impairment.

                             A remarkable finding of our study was that workers who preferred to telework had greater work functioning impairment. The preference for teleworking could be based on difficulties with working in the workplace owing to ill health or work–family conflicts. Previous studies have reported that workers who prefer telework choose teleworking when feeling unwell because this allows them to work at their own pace and freely adjust their break time.

                             The current study showed that frequent teleworking was associated with work functioning impairment. One important mechanism for this association could be that individuals with health problems are more likely to choose to telework.

Some studies have suggested that teleworking is associated with poor health conditions, such as depression and musculoskeletal pain.

                             This study has several public health implications. First, governments should create a system that enables teleworkers to continue working with reduced work function. Early detection of work functioning impairment is more difficult in telework than in the workplace where there is face-to-face interaction. Strategies to check work function are necessary, even for teleworkers. For example, a checklist to verify the work function of teleworkers should be developed and promoted for regular use. Second, companies should pay attention to background factors that reduce the work function of teleworkers. Identifying needed support for teleworkers will prevent impaired work function. Third, companies should assess the risk of absence from work for individual workers and provide appropriate work accommodations in cooperation with occupational health staff. Occupational health staff should have online meetings with teleworkers to check for any health problems and provide information on health management when teleworking.

                             Our study has several limitations: First, the self-reported data used in our study may be inaccurate. Self-reporting may lead to systematic errors, which may reduce or increase the significance of the differences. Second, this was a cross-sectional study, and it is not possible to determine causality. For example, we cannot determine whether there is a causal relationship between teleworking frequency and teleworking preferences.

                             In conclusion, the current study findings suggest that a teleworking preference is associated with work functioning impairment and one factor that increases the teleworking frequency. This result may be explained by workers who have difficulties with working in the workplace owing to ill health or work–family conflicts prefer to telework. Employees who telework frequently should be carefully monitored to determine whether the ability to perform their job is impaired. Investigating the background regarding the choice to telework could provide clues to understanding the support needed by teleworkers, which will help to prevent health problems and lead to increased productivity among these workers.
