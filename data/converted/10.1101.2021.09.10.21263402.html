To understand how mass nutritional supplementation, treatment of wasting, and vaccination affect the dynamics of a vaccine-preventable infection, we developed a population-level, compartmental model of measles transmission stratified by age and nutrition status. We simulated a range of scenarios to assess the potential reductions in measles infection and mortality associated with targeted therapeutic feeding for children who are wasted and with a mass supplementation intervention. Nutrition interventions were assumed to increase engagement with the health sector, leading to increased vaccination rates. We found that the combination of wasting treatment and mass supplementation coverage followed by an increase in vaccination coverage of non-wasted children from a baseline of 75% to 85%, leads to 34-57% and 65-77% reduction in measles infection and mortality and 56-60% reduction in overall mortality among wasted children, compared with the wasting treatment alone. Our work highlights the synergistic benefits that may be achieved by leveraging mass nutritional supplementation as a touch point with the health system, to increase rates of vaccination and improve child survival beyond what would be expected from the additive benefits of each intervention.

                             The bidirectional interaction between undernutrition and infection can be devastating to child health. Nutritional deficiencies impair immunity and increase susceptibility to infection. Simultaneously, infections compound undernutrition by increasing metabolic demand, and impairing nutrient absorption. Treatment of acute malnutrition (wasting) can reverse some of its deleterious effects and reduce susceptibility to infectious diseases. Nutrition-specific approaches may be packaged with other interventions, including immunization, to support overall child health. To understand how mass nutritional supplementation, treatment of wasting, and vaccination affect the dynamics of a vaccine-preventable infection, we developed a population-level, compartmental model of measles transmission stratified by age and nutrition status. We simulated a range of scenarios to assess the potential reductions in measles infection and mortality associated with targeted therapeutic feeding for children who are wasted and with a mass supplementation intervention. Nutrition interventions were assumed to increase engagement with the health sector, leading to increased vaccination rates. We found that the combination of wasting treatment and mass supplementation coverage followed by an increase in vaccination coverage of non-wasted children from a baseline of 75% to 85%, leads to 34-57% and 65-77% reduction in measles infection and mortality and 56-60% reduction in overall mortality among wasted children, compared with the wasting treatment alone. Our work highlights the synergistic benefits that may be achieved by leveraging mass nutritional supplementation as a touch point with the health system, to increase rates of vaccination and improve child survival beyond what would be expected from the additive benefits of each intervention.

                             Undernutrition and infection interact in a bidirectional manner. Both micronutrient and macronutrient deficiencies stunt a child’s growth, impair immunity, increase susceptibility to infection, and worsen outcomes from common infectious diseases.

                             The risk of adverse outcomes from infectionis correlated with the degree of undernutrition; concurrently, infection contributes to undernutrition by reducing a child’s ability to consume food, by contributing to nutrient malabsorption, and by increasing metabolic demand.

                             Interventions focused on treating or preventing undernutrition often rely upon increasing the engagement of mothers and children with the health sector. Intentionally packaging nutrition-specific care with routine immunization could lead to enhanced effectiveness in reducing undernutrition but also improve prevention efforts against infectious disease. In fact, nutritional commodities may be perceived as an incentive to draw patients to health centers where other services may be offered. Previous work has shown that an incentive as simple as a bag of lentils for each immunization visit, has large positive impacts on the uptake of immunization services in resource poor areas.

                             We developed apopulation-level, dynamic model of measles transmission stratified by nutrition status to understand how nutrition-based interventions and vaccination collectively affect measles infection and mortality. In particular, we modeled two scenarios. In the first, wasted children received treatment with ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). The second included treatment of wasted children, as well as mass supplementation of all children 6-23 months with small quantity lipid-based nutritional supplements (SQ-LNS). Lipid-based nutritional supplements (LNS) are a class of ready-to-use food supplements that are highly nutrient-dense and fortified with vitamins and minerals at levels designed to treat and prevent acute malnutrition. They range in ration sizes based on their use to either treat or prevent acute malnutrition, with ready-to-use therapeutic or supplementary foods (RUTF, RUSF) coming in 92- or 100-gram sachets, medium-quantity LNS in 50 gram sachets, and 20-gram sachets of SQ-LNS for home fortification of local diets to improve children’s complementary feeding. There is strong evidence in support of implementing mass SQ-LNS supplementation among at-risk children from 6-18 or 23 months, like those in Niger.

                             We accounted for the nature, timing, and magnitude of interactions between measles and undernutrition under the different simulated scenarios. Model parameters reflected the situation in Niger, which was considered to be an appropriate case study due to its high rates of undernutrition and its persistent measles burden. Undernutrition is the leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity in Niger.

                             Our modeling scenarios can help us understand the complex connections between undernutrition and measles that have not been disentangled by previous studies and may help inform approaches to intervention. There is strong evidence for the positive impact on preventing undernutrition and mortality through mass supplementation with child-adapted foods like SQ-LNS. If our model demonstrates an additive benefit of increased measles vaccination, it would justify further investment by governments and donors in scaling-up such programs especially in areas with a simultaneous high burden of malnutrition and low coverage for measles vaccination.

An underlying assumption is that unvaccinated wasted children who receive therapeutic feeding are given the measles vaccine during week 4 of treatment, as is indicated by most treatment protocols. Rates of treated and vaccinated individuals were converted to the proportions and shown in figures.

                              shows how the combination of wasting treatment and measles vaccination coverage impacts measles outcomes. Increasing the treatment coverage of wasted children from 5% to 95%, followed by vaccination coverage of children who received treatment from 5% to 95%, leads to up to a 36% reduction in measles cases (from 2673 to 2039 per 100,000 population), and 50% reduction in measles mortality (from 125 to 75 per 100,000 population) In addition to these benefits seen for the overall population of children, the combination of wasting treatment coverage from 5% to 95% followed by measles immunization coverage from 5% to 95% reduces the measles infection and mortality among wasted children specifically by 71%, and overall mortality of wasted children by 69% (Fig. S3).

Assuming that in the prevention scenario 75% of non-wasted children who received nutrition supplementation received vaccination, and in the treatment scenario, 75% of wasted children receive treatment, and 75% vaccination coverage of treated children, number of infected cases per 100,000 wasted children reduced from 13574 (Scenario 1. treatment scenario) to 6260 (Scenario 2. prevention scenario) and to 4929 (Scenario 3. treatment + prevention scenario). Number of measles deaths per 100,000 wasted children was also reduced from 1900 (treatment scenario) to 876 (prevention scenario) and to 690 (treatment + prevention scenario) (Fig. S9). Similar results were obtained for the measles infection as well as measles mortality per 100,000 population (Fig. S8). Provision of mass nutritional supplementation reduced the number of wasted children and therefore, the number of wasted infected children. This effect was much larger than the treatment effect. Scenarios 2 and 3 have similar impact sizes on measles burden, emphasizing that prevention is a more effective approach than treatment (Fig. S8 and Fig. S9).

However, precise quantities to inform some of the model parameters are unknown or unavailable, specifically, the increase in infectious period and increase in susceptibility to measles due to wasting (η, θ). Simulation over a range of values for one parameter with others fixed allows us to examine the effect of Scenario 1 on multiple model outcomes. As the magnitude of wasting effects – such as susceptibility effect and duration of infectious period – get larger, they result in an increase in the number of infected children, and number of deaths per 100,000 wasted children aged 6-23 months old, assuming the vaccination coverage of children who received treatment varied between 67.5% to 100% and the wasting treatment coverages varies between 5% to 100% (Fig. S10 and Fig. S11). For instance, an increase in susceptibility effect from θ = 2 to θ = 4, leads to, on average, a 50% increases in measles infection among wasted children (from 13988 to 22085 per 100,000 wasted children aged 6-23 months old per year) (Fig. S10). Varying other parameter values such as increased measles mortality due to wasting (ϕ), or proportion who recover from wasting after measles infection (d) does not lead to a noticeable difference in the simulation results for the number of infected cases. Further sensitivity analyses using the LHS-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) index and generating a matrix of 5000 sample points in the 9-dimensional unit cube (all parameters) indicate that σ (measles-induced mortality probability) θ (susceptibility impact of measles infection) have the strongest influence on both measles infection and measles mortality outcomes (Fig. S12). In addition, mortality due to measles among wasted children aged 6-23 months old is sensitive to ϕ (increased measles mortality due to wasting).

                             Substantive barriers to improving child health in resource-limited settings include persistently high rates of undernutrition and low rates of vaccine coverage for common infections such as measles. Given the close bidirectional relationship between childhood undernutrition and infectious diseases among vulnerable populations, there may be opportunities for synergy wherein the treatment and/or prevention of one condition leads to decreased rates of the other. Our work aims to capture the dynamic interactions between undernutrition and measles, so as to estimate the impact of treatment of wasting, mass nutritional supplementation for nutritionally at-risk populations, and measles vaccine coverage on measles infection and mortality.

                             Our models demonstrate a strong effect of mass nutritional supplementation in reducing measles infection and death, as well as overall mortality, if such an intervention could be leveraged to incentivize measles vaccination uptake. Importantly, modestly increasing measles vaccination coverage by providing vaccination at the same time and location as blanket nutritional supplementation leads to sizeable reductions in measles cases and mortality well above treatment of wasting or increased vaccine uptake alone. In addition to the synergic effect, our dynamical model demonstrates the nonlinear impacts of these interventions on measles burden.

                             Our results show that mass supplementation alone and mass supplementation combined with wasting treatment have a similar effect size on reducing measles infection and mortality. Mass supplementation with SQ-LNS coupled with vaccination would likely be more cost-effective than the individual treatment of wasting alone which, in high burden countries, puts financial pressures on vulnerable and poorly resourced health systems. Future work should explore the cost-effectiveness of integrated interventions. We used model parameters based on data from Niger, a nation plagued by a high burden of undernutrition, where interventions focused on the early childhood nutrition have the potential for a large impact on measles infection rates. Niger has made very little progress towards achieving international targets for decreasing stunting and wasting.

                             Our results suggest that mass nutritional supplementation among vulnerable populations using SQ-LNS has over twice the effect on reducing measles infection and mortality as well as overall mortality among wasted children, compared with treatment of wasted children alone, assuming both methods lead to increased vaccination coverage. Therefore, expanding the reach of mass nutritional supplementation, including providing nutrition supplementation during routine immunization visits, could help Niger make progress towards lowering the incidence of wasting, as well as indirectly improve vaccination coverage. The models could be applied to other countries like Chad, Nigeria, or the Democratic Republic of Congo which have a similar burden of undernutrition as Niger but much lower measles vaccination coverage.

                             As with all models, there are some limitations to our work. Our work is theoretical, however our sensitivity analyses show that our model is robust to choice of parameter values, and thus is a call for more empirical studies. Although we account for multiple interactions between measles and undernutrition, there are several features of the complex system of measles epidemiology that were not included in the model. For instance, we did not account for any potential impact of undernutrition on measles vaccine leading to a potential delay in response to vaccine or waning of vaccine, as it is under-explored in the literature.

                             In addition, one of the complications that malnourished children experience following measles infection, is post-measles diarrhea which exacerbates nutrient loss.

                             Accounting for this could help us better identify the impacts of infection on children’s nutritional status. Also, among surviving children following measles infection a certain percentage experience blindness, a certain percentage with some residual pneumonia, and quite significantly a certain percentage with a residual post-measles immunodeficiency. The reported deaths due to measles do not account for mortality from these various comorbidities.

                             In addition, assessing the potential increased pathogenicity of measles as a result of undernutrition would be useful in understanding the cyclic relationship between the two events to develop more effective interventions. More field data to constrain model parameters around the relationship between measles infection and undernutrition would allow for increasingly rigorous quantification of direct and indirect impacts of nutrition interventions. Also, nutrition interventions that led to rises in vaccination coverage were assumed to be delivered at health centers and at regular intervals. It will also be important to investigate different distribution models for supplementation in order to retain contact with health personnel without placing undue burden on already overworked caretakers.

                             Given the complex interactions between undernutrition and infectious diseases, it is still challenging to recognize where and at what level specific interventions can be most effective. The large contribution of undernutrition and infection to the global burden of disease increases the importance of studying these two processes. Our study offers a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between measles transmission dynamics and undernutrition and helps motivate advocacy for nutrition-focused interventions based on their multidimensional impacts. This work also helps understand how the addition of nutritional status, preventive nutrition interventions, and therapeutic treatments into mathematical models of vaccine-preventable diseases can better explain increased susceptibility to infection despite achieving certain vaccine coverage levels. This model also has implications for understanding other indirect benefits of increased care-seeking due to engagement with the health system for nutrition-based interventions. When considering how health systems with limited budgets should spend their money to achieve maximal benefit, we have shown here that leveraging mass nutritional supplementation as a contact point with the health system to even modestly increase measles vaccination coverage has a synergistic benefit beyond either intervention alone. Such a double impact could be even more important in areas where both malnutrition and measles are rising because of conflict, climate shocks, and disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic.
