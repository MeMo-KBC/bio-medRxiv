  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background and Objectives This study tested the hypothesis that treatment of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in the upper trapezius muscle (UTM) with repeated injection of 1% lidocaine results in better alleviation of muscular stiffness and soreness as well as improved metabolism in the hypercontracted MTrP area than treatment with radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT).

Materials and Methods A single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted on patients suffering from MTrPs in the UTM. Thirty patients were treated with repeated injection of 2 ml of 1% lidocaine (three injections; one injection per week). Another 30 patients were treated with rESWT (three treatment sessions; one treatment session per week; 2000 radial extracorporeal shock waves per treatment session; positive energy flux density = 0.10 mJ/mm2). The primary outcome measure was pain severity using the VAS score. The secondary outcome measures included muscle elasticity index, pressure pain threshold and neck disability index. Evaluation was performed at baseline (T1), 15-30 minutes after the first treatment in order to register immediate treatment effects (T2), before the second treatment (i.e., one week after baseline) (T3) and one week after the third treatment (i.e., four weeks after baseline) (T4).

Results There were no statistically significant differences in the primary and secondary outcome measures between the patients in the lidocaine arm and the patients in the rESWT arm at T1 and T4. Within the arms, the mean differences of all outcomes were statistically significant (P < 0.001) when comparing the data obtained at T1 with the data obtained at T3 and the data obtained at T4.

Conclusions The results of this pilot study suggest that the use of rESWT in patients with MTrPs in the UTM is safe and leads to reduced pain and improved muscle elasticty, pressure pain threshold and neck disability index, without adverse effects. Larger trials are necessary to verify this. Clinicians should consider rESWT instead of injections of lidocaine in the treatment of MTrPs in the UTM.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background and Objectives This study tested the hypothesis that treatment of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in the upper trapezius muscle (UTM) with repeated injection of 1% lidocaine results in better alleviation of muscular stiffness and soreness as well as improved metabolism in the hypercontracted MTrP area than treatment with radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT).

Materials and Methods A single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted on patients suffering from MTrPs in the UTM. Thirty patients were treated with repeated injection of 2 ml of 1% lidocaine (three injections; one injection per week). Another 30 patients were treated with rESWT (three treatment sessions; one treatment session per week; 2000 radial extracorporeal shock waves per treatment session; positive energy flux density = 0.10 mJ/mm2). The primary outcome measure was pain severity using the VAS score. The secondary outcome measures included muscle elasticity index, pressure pain threshold and neck disability index. Evaluation was performed at baseline (T1), 15-30 minutes after the first treatment in order to register immediate treatment effects (T2), before the second treatment (i.e., one week after baseline) (T3) and one week after the third treatment (i.e., four weeks after baseline) (T4).

Results There were no statistically significant differences in the primary and secondary outcome measures between the patients in the lidocaine arm and the patients in the rESWT arm at T1 and T4. Within the arms, the mean differences of all outcomes were statistically significant (P < 0.001) when comparing the data obtained at T1 with the data obtained at T3 and the data obtained at T4.

Conclusions The results of this pilot study suggest that the use of rESWT in patients with MTrPs in the UTM is safe and leads to reduced pain and improved muscle elasticty, pressure pain threshold and neck disability index, without adverse effects. Larger trials are necessary to verify this. Clinicians should consider rESWT instead of injections of lidocaine in the treatment of MTrPs in the UTM.

                              This study tested the hypothesis that treatment of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in the upper trapezius muscle (UTM) with repeated injection of 1% lidocaine results in better alleviation of muscular stiffness and soreness as well as improved metabolism in the hypercontracted MTrP area than treatment with radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT).

                              A single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted on patients suffering from MTrPs in the UTM. Thirty patients were treated with repeated injection of 2 ml of 1% lidocaine (three injections; one injection per week). Another 30 patients were treated with rESWT (three treatment sessions; one treatment session per week; 2000 radial extracorporeal shock waves per treatment session; positive energy flux density = 0.10 mJ/mm2). The primary outcome measure was pain severity using the VAS score. The secondary outcome measures included muscle elasticity index, pressure pain threshold and neck disability index. Evaluation was performed at baseline (T1), 15-30 minutes after the first treatment in order to register immediate treatment effects (T2), before the second treatment (i.e., one week after baseline) (T3) and one week after the third treatment (i.e., four weeks after baseline) (T4).

                              There were no statistically significant differences in the primary and secondary outcome measures between the patients in the lidocaine arm and the patients in the rESWT arm at T1 and T4. Within the arms, the mean differences of all outcomes were statistically significant (P < 0.001) when comparing the data obtained at T1 with the data obtained at T3 and the data obtained at T4.

                              The results of this pilot study suggest that the use of rESWT in patients with MTrPs in the UTM is safe and leads to reduced pain and improved muscle elasticty, pressure pain threshold and neck disability index, without adverse effects. Larger trials are necessary to verify this. Clinicians should consider rESWT instead of injections of lidocaine in the treatment of MTrPs in the UTM.

                             Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a condition characterized by local and referred pain as well as autonomic symptoms, which are all produced by myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). The most widely accepted hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of MTrPs is sustained sarcomere contraction due to excessive acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction on the basis of overuse or muscle injury [

                             ]. Pain is produced by the contracted muscle tissue compressing the blood vessels, causing local ischemia and vasoneuroactive release, especially at the site of the MTrPs [

The neurogenic inflammatory effect and tissue swelling lead to an energy crisis, obstruction of calcium intake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and prevention of sarcomere shrinkage. Some studies utilized microdialysis (i.e., intramuscular biochemical analysis without taking biopsies) to understand the biological characteristics of MTrPs [

Elasticity variations can be detected as color variance in elastograms. Some equipment can calculate the strain ratio (SR) between two regions of interest (ROI), allowing imaging findings to be quantified and reference values to be provided. Only a few studies used UE to assess MPS and MTrPs so far, but demonstrated more objective diagnosis of MTrPs and improved monitoring of treatment success compared with other diagnostic measures [

Treatment success was assessed using objective (elasticity index (EI)) and subjective (visual analogue score (VAS) of pain, pressure pain threshold (PPT)) outcome measures.

                             In addition, all patients were taught a simple home exercise routine of UTM stretching during the first visit. The patients received a video file of the UTM stretching exercise on their mobile phones. Patients had to finish 10 sessions of UTM stretching twice a day. For ethical concerns, patients were allowed to take acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if the discomfort became intolerable, depending on the pain severity. The amount of acetaminophen and NSIADs was recorded.

                             The primary outcome measure was pain severity using the VAS score. The secondary outcome measures included muscle elasticity index (EI), pressure pain threshold (PPT) and neck disability index (NDI). Evaluation was performed at baseline (T1), 15-30 minutes after the first treatment session in order to register immediate treatment effects (T2), before the second treatment session (i.e., one week after baseline) (T3) and one week after the third treatment session (i.e., four weeks after baseline) (T4).

A clinically significant difference in pain severity was represented by a mean reduction in VAS of 2.0 cm, which correlates to effective therapy [

Independent T-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables (depending on normality) were used to compare baseline characteristics between the arms; Fisher’s exact test was used to compare baseline characteristics for the categorical variable Gender between the arms. A 2×3 repeated measures analysis of variance was used on the outcome measures, with time (T1, T2, T3 and T4) as the within-subject component and treatment (lidocaine, rESWT) as the between-subject factor. When the sphericity assumption was broken, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used. The significance values were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction.

                             Our study had two major results: (1) All outcome measures were statistically significantly improved after the first injection of lidocaine compared to the situation after the first rESWT session (

Accordingly, if one is primarily interested in initial pain relief as fast as possible in treatment of MTrPs of the UTM, injection of lidocaine may be the first choice. However, this comes at the price of an invasive therapy with the risk of bacterial and viral contamination of the treated muscle, as well as potential myotoxicity [

                             ). Because rESWT does not share the disadvantages of injections of lidocaine (rESWT is not invasive, does not cause potential bacterial and viral contamination of the treated muscle, and is not myotoxic), rESWT appears to be the better choice if one is interested in effective and safe treatment of MTrPs of the UTM with lasting effects. The latter is indicated by results of a recent study on treatment of functional and structural muscle injuries in professional athetes using the same rESWT device that was used in this study [

                             Altered flexibility of the UTM following rESWT could be one of the mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects of rESWT on MTrPs. However, this is only one of many potential mechanisms that may explain the outcome of this study. Other potential mechanisms are briefly summarized in the following. (i) rESWT improved the NDI, which is consistent with previous findings [
                             <a id="xref-ref-21-6" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21">

                             ]. One may speculate that this was caused at least in part by mechanical separation of actin and myosin filaments in MTrPs. (ii) Exposure of muscle tissue to rESWs may result in temporary disruption of nerve transmission at the neuromuscular junction [

                             ]. (iii) Substance P, a pain neurotransmitter, may be abundant in active MTrPs [

(v) Reduced lubricin expression is involved in the pathophysiology of MTrPs, and ESWT may help by increasing lubricin expression in septa [
                             <a id="xref-ref-54-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-54">

                             ]. (vi) Another mechanism for pain relief could be increased muscle microcirculation as a result of repetitive ESWT [
                             <a id="xref-ref-55-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-55">

                             ]. Deciphering the exact molecular and cellular mechanisms resulting in reduced VAS pain and improved EI, PPT and NDI would require to take muscle biopsies and/or performing microdialysis, which may be performed in future studies. Such studies may also include a subsequent trial of combined rESWT and lidocaine injection, and employing rESWT for 2000 rESWs per treatment session as performed in this study, to account for both needle effect, lidocaine effect, and rESWT regeneration effects in the same session.

                             ]). This is important because the use of fESWT is restricted to physicians in many countries (as is the case in Germany where chiropractors and physiotherapists who have been trained in Germany are not legally entitled to use fESWT). Moreover, the International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST) has recommended that only a qualified physician (certified by National or International Societies) may use fESWT in their latest Consensus Statement regarding ESWT indications and contraindications [

                             ]. However, in many countries a medical doctor may not be available to perform treatment of MTrPs of the UTM as performed in this study. This is also the reason why e.g. a randomized controlled trial on acute Type 3b hamstring muscle injuries currently being undertaken is based on rESWT rather than on fESWT [

                             Our study has some limitations. First, the patients were not blinded to the therapy, which may have caused some subjective bias. Second, there were no subgroups with variable rESWT intensities, intervals, or frequencies because total energy is dose-dependent, which could alter therapy benefits and cost-effectiveness. Identifying appropriate regimens and conducting cost-effective assessments should be a priority in the future. Third, this study was not a non-inferiority trial. Accordingly, this study could not establish that rESWT is as effective as injections of lidocaine in treatment of MTrPs of the UTM. Fourth, this study’s target demographic was individuals aged 20 to 25 years, avoiding MPS in combination with degenerative joint issues, which is typical in the elderly.

                             The results of this pilot study suggest that the use of rESWT in patients with MTrPs in the UTM is safe and leads to reduced pain and improved muscle elasticty, pressure pain threshold and neck disability index, without adverse effects. Larger trials are necessary to verify this. Clinicians should consider rESWT instead of injections of lidocaine in the treatment of MTrPs in the UTM.
