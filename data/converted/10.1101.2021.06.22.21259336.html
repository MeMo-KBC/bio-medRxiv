  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Mobility data have demonstrated major changes in human movement patterns in response to COVID-19 and associated interventions in many countries. This can involve sub-national redistribution, short-term relocations as well as international migration. In this paper, we combine detailed location data from Facebook measuring the location of approximately 6 million daily active Facebook users in 5km[2][1] tiles in the UK with census-derived population estimates to measure population mobility and redistribution. We provide time-varying population estimates and assess spatial population changes with respect to population density and four key reference dates in 2020 (First lockdown, End of term, Beginning of term, Christmas). We also show how population estimates derived from the distribution of Facebook users vary compared to mid-2020 small area population estimates by the UK national statistics agencies. We estimate that between March 2020 and March 2021, the total population of the UK declined and we identify important spatial variations in this population change, showing that low-density areas have experienced lower population decreases than urban areas. We estimate that, for the top 10% highest population tiles, the population has decreased by 6.6%. Further, we provide evidence that geographic redistributions of population within the UK coincide with dates of non-pharmaceutical interventions including lockdowns and movement restrictions, as well as seasonal patterns of migration around holiday dates. The methods used in this study reveal significant changes in population distribution at high spatial and temporal resolutions that have not previously been quantified by available demographic surveys in the UK. We found early indicators of potential longer-term changes in the population distribution of the UK although it is not clear if these changes may persist after the COVID-19 pandemic.

  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Mobility data have demonstrated major changes in human movement patterns in response to COVID-19 and associated interventions in many countries. This can involve sub-national redistribution, short-term relocations as well as international migration. In this paper, we combine detailed location data from Facebook measuring the location of approximately 6 million daily active Facebook users in 5km[2][1] tiles in the UK with census-derived population estimates to measure population mobility and redistribution. We provide time-varying population estimates and assess spatial population changes with respect to population density and four key reference dates in 2020 (First lockdown, End of term, Beginning of term, Christmas). We also show how population estimates derived from the distribution of Facebook users vary compared to mid-2020 small area population estimates by the UK national statistics agencies. We estimate that between March 2020 and March 2021, the total population of the UK declined and we identify important spatial variations in this population change, showing that low-density areas have experienced lower population decreases than urban areas. We estimate that, for the top 10% highest population tiles, the population has decreased by 6.6%. Further, we provide evidence that geographic redistributions of population within the UK coincide with dates of non-pharmaceutical interventions including lockdowns and movement restrictions, as well as seasonal patterns of migration around holiday dates. The methods used in this study reveal significant changes in population distribution at high spatial and temporal resolutions that have not previously been quantified by available demographic surveys in the UK. We found early indicators of potential longer-term changes in the population distribution of the UK although it is not clear if these changes may persist after the COVID-19 pandemic.

                             Mobility data have demonstrated major changes in human movement patterns in response to COVID-19 and associated interventions in many countries. This can involve sub-national redistribution, short-term relocations as well as international migration. In this paper, we combine detailed location data from Facebook measuring the location of approximately 6 million daily active Facebook users in 5km

                             tiles in the UK with census-derived population estimates to measure population mobility and redistribution. We provide time-varying population estimates and assess spatial population changes with respect to population density and four key reference dates in 2020 (First lockdown, End of term, Beginning of term, Christmas). We also show how population estimates derived from the distribution of Facebook users vary compared to mid-2020 small area population estimates by the UK national statistics agencies. We estimate that between March 2020 and March 2021, the total population of the UK declined and we identify important spatial variations in this population change, showing that low-density areas have experienced lower population decreases than urban areas. We estimate that, for the top 10% highest population tiles, the population has decreased by 6.6%. Further, we provide evidence that geographic redistributions of population within the UK coincide with dates of non-pharmaceutical interventions including lockdowns and movement restrictions, as well as seasonal patterns of migration around holiday dates. The methods used in this study reveal significant changes in population distribution at high spatial and temporal resolutions that have not previously been quantified by available demographic surveys in the UK. We found early indicators of potential longer-term changes in the population distribution of the UK although it is not clear if these changes may persist after the COVID-19 pandemic.

                             In this paper, we focus on creating estimates of changes in the UK population distribution at a high spatial and temporal resolution to address existing gaps in our understanding of the population distribution in the UK across continuous time scales. We propose a method for generalising the location of Facebook users to the entire UK population, and provide population estimates that “fill in” missing data between census population estimates. We show large disruptions in the population distribution of the UK in the first year of the COVID- 19 pandemic, with population relocations coinciding with seasonal patterns of movement and the dates of public health interventions. We also observe an overall trend of decreased populations in urban areas. We compare time-varying population estimates derived from Facebook users to mid-2020 population estimates from UK national statistics agencies, showing how within-year dynamic populations differ from annual population estimates. This has important implications for modelling approaches that employ static population estimates, as estimates may not reflect the time-varying nature of underlying populations.

We used 2019 mid-year estimates as they are the closest estimates available to the baseline period of the Facebook data.

                              To understand the usual spatial distribution of Facebook users, we used Facebook-generated baseline estimates of population calculated in the 45 days before March 10th, from January 25th to March 9th, 2020. This baseline period is automatically back-calculated by Facebook prior to data sharing and provides the earliest available information on the distribution of Facebook users in the dataset. Before applying the population adjustment, we compared the population of Facebook users in the baseline period to census population estimates across the UK to identify spatial variations in the distribution of Facebook users and census population (

                              , Supplemental Figure 1). We found a different median percentage of Facebook users to population in each of the three 8-hour reporting periods (00:00 to 08:00, 08:00 to 16:00, and 16:00 to 0:00), of 7.46%, 9.1%, and 9.77% respectively (

                              ). These distributions reflect differences in the number of people actively using Facebook services at different times of day. During the baseline period, we found that the majority of tiles (77%) have percentages of Facebook usage between 5 and 20% (Supplementary Figure 3). There are some tiles where Facebook usage exceeds 75%, which was typically observed in low population tiles. Extreme discrepancies greater than 100% Facebook usage, observed in 33 tiles in total, may result from interference from sparse cellular network coverage (Supplemental Figure 4).

We observed a sustained decrease in the population of London between March 10th, 2020 and the implementation of public health measures on March 23rd, 2020. Comparing the 14 days before and after the first national lockdown, the population of London decreased by 3.44% (196,000 people). Further, we estimate the population of London was 646,000 lower in total between March 2020, and March 2021, with some periods of even lower population observed during the summer and Christmas holidays. Between March 2020 and March 2021, the population decreased in the 20 largest BUAs in the UK, with the largest decreases observed in Greater London, West Midlands, and Greater Manchester BUAs.

                              The absolute daily difference in the population size of each tile indicates the daily degree of population flux. The total absolute daily difference across the UK had strong short-term periodicity, but on a weekly level, changes in flux were clearly visible in association with the four key reference dates (

                              ). Additionally, other national interventions also showed responses with this metric, including the second national lockdown on November 2nd 2020 marked with a 1, and the reopening of schools on March 8th (schools in the UK were shut after January 1st 2020) marked with a 2.

                              We measured population changes in areas of different population density by dividing tiles into deciles based on their census population size (Supplemental Figure 8) and calculating time-varying population estimates for these deciles (

                              ). We found large decreases in the most populous decile in the first lockdown period, with the greatest increase in population observed in the 2nd most populous decile (

                              ). In the summer, we observed a decrease in the top two most populous deciles and a more even distribution of population among the remaining deciles, including the least populous. This reflects movement to rural areas coinciding with the beginning of summer holidays. The summer pattern is mirrored by a decrease in less populous tiles in the return to school period. Finally, we observed a similar, though reduced pattern of population decrease in the Christmas period where population in the most populous decile decreased, while in less populous deciles it increased.

This decile shows a smaller response to Christmas than others, with the most pronounced increases in the central deciles. Of note is that most deciles did not return to the pre-Christmas population sizes, suggesting that people could have remained where they travelled for Christmas as the UK entered new restrictions on 26th December. We estimated that, for the top 10% highest population tiles, the population has decreased by 6.6%.

Because the Facebook population was generalized from mid-2019 census population estimates, the total population of the UK was underestimated compared to mid-2020 census population estimates by 2,899,000 individuals (4%), relating to an overall decline in the population of Facebook users. However, Facebook estimated a reduction of 2,635,000 (6%) in the highest population decile compared to mid-2020 census estimates which may indicate a redistribution of UK population out of the populous areas which is not captured in census estimates.

                              Deviations between dynamic and census populations can also affect estimates of the impact of the epidemic in real-time. Some statistics, like the rate of cases per 100,000 rely on census population estimates to calculate disease incidence relative to a population. We found that the inclusion of time-varying population estimates led to changes in the calculated COVID-19 incidence rates, leading to an altered interpretation of the severity of outbreaks in different areas (

                              ). Using time-varying population estimates, we identified differences in the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the 8 largest BUAs in England ranging between 23.24% and −3.26% of the rate calculated with static populations (Supplemental Figures 12- 13). This difference between epidemic rates reflects changes in the underlying population of these areas through time. 84% of the time-varying rates are within 10% of the rates computed using a static population. Nonetheless, the differences in epidemic rates are not trivial, particularly in urban areas during the period of highest COVID-19 cases between December 2020 and January 2021. The combined effect of high numbers of cases and population outflows from urban areas led to a consistent underestimation of the scale of the COVID-19 epidemics in the most populous Built-Up Areas (Supplemental Figures 10-11).

                             In this study, we present a novel approach for estimating population changes using a large, near-real time dataset of the location of millions of Facebook users in the UK. This study identifies important changes in the population of the UK coinciding with the announcement of public health interventions and with seasonal migrations in the UK. We provide evidence supporting previous reports of a decrease in population in urban areas. We also demonstrate how observed changes in population have varied in space and time. We show how these population changes can impact disease transmission and the predicted size of epidemics. This is particularly important for understanding how the timing of population changes relate to the progression of a disease epidemic. We also provide new estimates of the rate of cases using time-varying populations in different locations, which could be extended to other rates like calculated rates of vaccinations.

                             The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented changes in the population distribution of the UK. These changes include abrupt changes in population as well as broad trends of population change since the announcement of the first national lockdown in March 2020. Decreases in the population of the 20 largest urban areas in the UK have persisted throughout 2020 which may reflect new patterns of employment and home working. The trend of decreasing urban populations has not been monotonic, as the population of urban centers has increased during specific periods. Nor has the trend of population increases in less populous areas been uniform. As we demonstrate, rural populations have experienced unique population dynamics during public health interventions and seasonal migrations during summer holidays.

                             The population estimates calculated in this study are a novel resource for understanding the evolution of the UK population through time and could be used to “fill the gap” between census population estimates. In the future, these estimates can be compared to results from the 2021 census to gain a detailed understanding of their accuracy at a high spatial resolution, and to identify potential biases in the generalization method. It is important to note that demographic trends are informed by varying rates of births, deaths, immigration and emigration. Changes in commuting patterns, the labor market, and seasonal migrations also impact patterns of population change

                             We demonstrated that time-varying population estimates impact reported rates of disease incidence. Other measurements of disease impact (attack rate, hospitalisation rate) could also be calculated by incorporating contemporaneous (time-varying) estimates of population. While this information is useful for retrospective reinterpretations of the severity of disease in particular locations, it would be particularly valuable for the modelling of disease spread, where time-varying population estimates could more accurately reflect population distributions in real time.

                             This study and the proposed method of population generalisation have a number of limitations. As the basis for our population generalisation, we use the closest available census population estimates to the baseline period. As demonstrated in this study, the population of the UK experiences dynamic redistributions and it is not possible to identify any population changes which occurred between the time of census estimation and the baseline period. The estimates presented in this study will be valuable for comparison to results from the 2021 census and can provide further information on the use of alternative sources of population data for measuring patterns of population change.

                             . There is still a limited understanding of how user subsets from applications like Facebook vary from the general population and how this difference may be reflected in aggregated location metrics. In the future, research on the bias of these user subsets could be used to improve the generalisation of the behaviour of these individuals for representing the entire population.
