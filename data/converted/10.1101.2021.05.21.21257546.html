  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Childhood exposure to enteric pathogens associated with poor sanitation contributes to undernutrition, associated with adverse effects later in life. This trial assessed the independent and combined effects of nutrition and sanitation interventions on child growth outcomes and enteric pathogen infection in rural Cambodia, where the prevalence of childhood stunting remains high.

Methods We conducted a factorial cluster-randomised controlled trial of 4,015 households with 4,124 children (1-28 months of age at endline) across three rural provinces in Cambodia. Fifty-five communes (clusters) were randomly assigned to a control arm or one of three treatments: a nutrition-only arm, a sanitation-only arm, and a combined nutrition and sanitation arm receiving both treatments. The primary outcome was length-for-age Z-score (LAZ); other outcomes included weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ), stunting, wasting, underweight, and caregiver-reported diarrhoea. We assayed stool specimens from a subset of all children (n = 1,620) for 27 enteric pathogens (14 bacteria, 6 viruses, 3 protozoa, and 4 soil-transmitted helminths) and estimated effects of interventions on enteric pathogen detection and density. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The trial was pre-registered with ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN77820875).

Findings Self-reported adherence was high for the nutrition intervention but uptake was low for sanitation. Compared with a mean LAZ of -1.04 (SD 1.2) in the control arm, children in the nutrition-only arm (LAZ +0.08, 95% CI -0.01-0.18) and combined nutrition and sanitation arm (LAZ +0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.20) experienced greater linear growth; there were no measurable differences in LAZ in the sanitation-only arm (LAZ -0.05, 95% CI -0.16-0.05). We found no effect of any intervention (delivered independently or combined) on either enteric pathogen frequency or pathogen load in stool. Compared with a mean WAZ of -1.05 (SD 1.1) in the control arm, children in the nutrition-only arm (WAZ +0.10, 95% CI 0.00-0.19) and combined intervention arm (WAZ +0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.20) were heavier for their age; there was no difference in WAZ in the sanitation-only arm. There were no differences between arms in prevalence of stunting, wasting, underweight status, one-week period prevalence of diarrhoea, pathogen prevalence, or pathogen density in stool.

Interpretation Improvements in child growth in nutrition and combined nutrition and sanitation arms are consistent with previous efficacy trials of combined nutrition and sanitation interventions. We found no evidence that the sanitation intervention alone improved child growth or reduced enteric pathogen detection, having achieved only modest changes in access and use.

  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Background Childhood exposure to enteric pathogens associated with poor sanitation contributes to undernutrition, associated with adverse effects later in life. This trial assessed the independent and combined effects of nutrition and sanitation interventions on child growth outcomes and enteric pathogen infection in rural Cambodia, where the prevalence of childhood stunting remains high.

Methods We conducted a factorial cluster-randomised controlled trial of 4,015 households with 4,124 children (1-28 months of age at endline) across three rural provinces in Cambodia. Fifty-five communes (clusters) were randomly assigned to a control arm or one of three treatments: a nutrition-only arm, a sanitation-only arm, and a combined nutrition and sanitation arm receiving both treatments. The primary outcome was length-for-age Z-score (LAZ); other outcomes included weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ), stunting, wasting, underweight, and caregiver-reported diarrhoea. We assayed stool specimens from a subset of all children (n = 1,620) for 27 enteric pathogens (14 bacteria, 6 viruses, 3 protozoa, and 4 soil-transmitted helminths) and estimated effects of interventions on enteric pathogen detection and density. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The trial was pre-registered with ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN77820875).

Findings Self-reported adherence was high for the nutrition intervention but uptake was low for sanitation. Compared with a mean LAZ of -1.04 (SD 1.2) in the control arm, children in the nutrition-only arm (LAZ +0.08, 95% CI -0.01-0.18) and combined nutrition and sanitation arm (LAZ +0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.20) experienced greater linear growth; there were no measurable differences in LAZ in the sanitation-only arm (LAZ -0.05, 95% CI -0.16-0.05). We found no effect of any intervention (delivered independently or combined) on either enteric pathogen frequency or pathogen load in stool. Compared with a mean WAZ of -1.05 (SD 1.1) in the control arm, children in the nutrition-only arm (WAZ +0.10, 95% CI 0.00-0.19) and combined intervention arm (WAZ +0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.20) were heavier for their age; there was no difference in WAZ in the sanitation-only arm. There were no differences between arms in prevalence of stunting, wasting, underweight status, one-week period prevalence of diarrhoea, pathogen prevalence, or pathogen density in stool.

Interpretation Improvements in child growth in nutrition and combined nutrition and sanitation arms are consistent with previous efficacy trials of combined nutrition and sanitation interventions. We found no evidence that the sanitation intervention alone improved child growth or reduced enteric pathogen detection, having achieved only modest changes in access and use.

                              Childhood exposure to enteric pathogens associated with poor sanitation contributes to undernutrition, associated with adverse effects later in life. This trial assessed the independent and combined effects of nutrition and sanitation interventions on child growth outcomes and enteric pathogen infection in rural Cambodia, where the prevalence of childhood stunting remains high.

                              We conducted a factorial cluster-randomised controlled trial of 4,015 households with 4,124 children (1-28 months of age at endline) across three rural provinces in Cambodia. Fifty-five communes (clusters) were randomly assigned to a control arm or one of three treatments: a nutrition-only arm, a sanitation-only arm, and a combined nutrition and sanitation arm receiving both treatments. The primary outcome was length-for-age Z-score (LAZ); other outcomes included weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ), stunting, wasting, underweight, and caregiver-reported diarrhoea. We assayed stool specimens from a subset of all children (n = 1,620) for 27 enteric pathogens (14 bacteria, 6 viruses, 3 protozoa, and 4 soil-transmitted helminths) and estimated effects of interventions on enteric pathogen detection and density. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The trial was pre-registered with ISRCTN Registry (

                              </strong>
                              Self-reported adherence was high for the nutrition intervention but uptake was low for sanitation. Compared with a mean LAZ of -1.04 (SD 1.2) in the control arm, children in the nutrition-only arm (LAZ +0.08, 95% CI -0.01-0.18) and combined nutrition and sanitation arm (LAZ +0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.20) experienced greater linear growth; there were no measurable differences in LAZ in the sanitation-only arm (LAZ -0.05, 95% CI -0.16-0.05). We found no effect of any intervention (delivered independently or combined) on either enteric pathogen frequency or pathogen load in stool. Compared with a mean WAZ of -1.05 (SD 1.1) in the control arm, children in the nutrition-only arm (WAZ +0.10, 95% CI 0.00-0.19) and combined intervention arm (WAZ +0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.20) were heavier for their age; there was no difference in WAZ in the sanitation-only arm. There were no differences between arms in prevalence of stunting, wasting, underweight status, one-week period prevalence of diarrhoea, pathogen prevalence, or pathogen density in stool.

                              Improvements in child growth in nutrition and combined nutrition and sanitation arms are consistent with previous efficacy trials of combined nutrition and sanitation interventions. We found no evidence that the sanitation intervention alone improved child growth or reduced enteric pathogen detection, having achieved only modest changes in access and use.

                             The community-led total sanitation (CLTS) framework is an approach to ending open defecation (OD) through behavioural change and collective action rather than through the provision of hardware and materials. CLTS and other rural promotion-based interventions shift the focus from individual and household sanitation practices to a community-level concern over OD by triggering collective behaviour change through powerful emotional drivers such as shame and disgust, as well as positive motivators such as improved health, dignity, and pride.

We further hypothesised that combined nutrition and sanitation interventions would lead to synergistic improvements in linear growth beyond what was realised in either standalone intervention arm.

                              We implemented a two-by-two factorial cRCT in rural communes in three provinces in Cambodia: Battambang, Pursat, and Siem Reap. The communes targeted by the program were selected based on two criteria: communes where at least 30% of the population was living below the poverty line according to the 2011 Cambodia Ministry of Planning’s Commune Database; and communes where latrine subsidies were not then in place. This study is reported per the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline (see Supplementary Material for CONSORT checklist).

                              In 2015, prior to the start of project activities, we randomly assigned communes to one of three treatment arms (nutrition only, sanitation/hygiene only, combined nutrition and sanitation/hygiene) or control arm using a random number generator with reproducible seed in Stata 13 (Stata, College Station, TX). Randomisation was conducted at the commune level to limit the risk of contamination between study arms and all villages within each commune received the assigned intervention. Following randomisation, three communes were dropped from the trial due to objections from the local governments of overlap with other current programming. This resulted in 55 communes with treatment arms of different sizes: 11 communes in nutrition-only arm; 13 in sanitation-only arm; 12 in combined-intervention arm; and 19 in control arm (

The trial enrolled primary caregivers with a child who was born after intervention implementation began (up to 28 months prior) and who had lived in the commune during the child’s entire life, resulting in a participant population of children 1-28 months old. Neither participants nor field staff were masked to treatment status due to the nature of the interventions, but data collection teams were blinded to the arm assignment and number of treatment arms.

Two international non-governmental organizations—Save the Children and SNV— provided programmatic implementation and coordinated activities with local governments. The nutrition interventions included complementary feeding activities and education through community-based growth promotion sessions; caregiver groups; home visits; and conditional cash transfers (CCTs) linked to the utilization of key health and nutrition services focusing on first 1,000 days of life. The sanitation interventions consisted primarily of CLTS as it was delivered here, latrine vouchers coupled with supply-side support for sanitation and hygiene products, and social behaviours change communications (SBCC).

                              The survey was communicated in the Khmer language to assess household and child-level risk factors of children under 28 months of age. Enumerators completed in-home interviews with the primary caregiver of children in the household about basic household member information; breastfeeding and nutrition of children up to age 28 months; number of pregnancies and child births of the caregiver; intervention exposure and participation; household WASH conditions and practices; and household assets/characteristics to construct wealth scores (excluding WASH variables). We also documented process evaluation (PE) indicators based on self-reported receipt of, and participation in, intervention activities to assess intervention fidelty and adherence, respectively. We attempted to collect a stool sample from each child and randomly selected a subset of stools for analysis by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of 30 enteric pathogen genes using a custom-developed TaqMan Array Card (TAC; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, VA), as described in the Supplementary Material.

                              We assessed enteric pathogen-associated gene targets in 1,620 randomly selected stools that demonstrated acceptible amplification (of 4,114 stools total, see Supplementary Material): 305 from the nutrition arm, 333 from the sanitation arm, 438 from the combined-intervention arm, and 544 from the control arm. We detected at least one bacterial gene in 87% of all samples, at least one viral gene in 49% of samples, at least one protozoan gene in 20% of samples, and at least one STH gene in 2% of samples. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enteric pathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterovirus, Campylobacter spp., and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were the most prevalent pathogens (

We found no differences in the rate of bacterial, viral, protozoan, or STH gene co-detection between the control arm and any treatment arm or between the combined arm and the standalone intervention arms (

                              Examining prevalence of specific targets compared to the control arm, the nutrition-only arm demonstrated increased prevalence of any bacterial gene (PR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01, 1.11), adenovirus (PR 1.88, 95% CI 1.41, 2.51) and heat-labile/heat-stable ETEC (PR 2.00, 95% CI 1.19, 3.36) and reduced prevalence of EIEC/Shigella spp. (PR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39, 0.94). Children in the sanitation-only arm had less EPEC (PR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78, 1.00) compared to control. In the combined-intervention arm, atypical-EPEC prevalence decreased (PR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73, 0.98) while the prevalence increased for heat-stable ETEC (PR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01, 2.00), heat-labile/heat-stable ETEC (PR 1.74, 95% CI 1.06, 2.86), and any viral gene (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02, 1.31). We found similar mixed effects when comparing pathogen gene prevalence in individual treatment arms compared to the combined arm; there was slightly lower combined prevalence of any bacterial target (PR 0.96, 95% CI 0.91, 1.02) and enterovirus (PR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67, 1.00) in the sanitation-only arm, and we found higher prevalence of adenovirus (PR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07, 1.87) in the nutrition-only arm (

                             We found a modest effect on growth from the nutrition-only intervention and a greater effect in the combined intervention arm that was likely attributable to the nutrition intervention alone. By contrast, the sanitation intervention alone was not associated with growth improvements, relative to control conditions, and demonstrated significantly poorer growth than the combined intervention arm. The similar impacts on linear growth between the nutrition-only and combined intervention arms were consistent with the observed linear growth improvements being attributable primarily to the nutrition intervention alone, further suggesting that the addition of this sanitation intervention to the nutrition intervention did not produce synergistic effects. Intermediate outcomes of meal frequency and dietary diversity were similar between arms, so the observed effects may have been attributable to other elements of the nutrition or combined intervention not captured by these measures. We observed no meaningful differences between arms with respect to secondary outcome measures of WAZ, WLZ, stunting, wasting, underweight status, diarrhoea, mortality, pathogen prevalence, pathogen co-detection rate, or pathogen gene copy quantity. Although molecular detection of a specific pathogen in stool does not necessarily signal active enteric infection, potential for disease, or direct effects on the individual, it does unambiguously indicate prior exposure to that pathogen. Our specific pathogen targets were selected a priori based on a range of globally observed enteric pathogens and may not fully capture the relevant enteric pathogens in rural Cambodia; however, the consistently high pathogen prevalence across all treatment arms suggests the suite of interventions assessed in this trial did not prevent environmental exposure to enteric pathogens.

                             . The rapid pace of WASH development in rural Cambodia makes it challenging to measure the impact of specific programs. However, the lack of differences in other sanitation intervention adherence indicators suggests low overall uptake of the sanitation intervention and only modest increases in sanitation coverage attributable to the intervention, which were likely insufficient to reduce community exposure and transmission. Zoonotic transmission from domestic animals, for instance, was not addressed by this or many other WASH trials, as indicated by nearly 80% of households across all treatment arms lacking access to an area free of animals for children to safely play

                             The frequency and intensity of contact from program promoters was much greater in the nutrition intervention than the sanitation intervention. Recipients of the nutrition intervention participated in monthly activities, whereas the sanitation intervention consisted of one triggering session with infrequent follow-up visits. The lower contact frequency may explain the discrepancy in intervention adherence. Both arms receiving the nutrition programming reported higher levels of participation in the key intervention activities—including sanitation intervention activities—suggesting higher adherence to the nutrition intervention than the sanitation intervention. Self-reported CLTS participation rates were equally low in both the sanitation-only and control arms at 6%, while 14% of nutrition-only recipients and 25% of combined intervention recipients reported CLTS participation. The comparatively elevated CLTS participation in the nutrition-only arm may reflect biases embedded in the self-reporting process; given the 28+ months that had elapsed since the initial CLTS triggering session and the infrequency of CLTS follow-up visits, households that only received the sanitation intervention may have been less likely to recall programming of any kind than households that participated in the more frequent and intense nutrition intervention activities. Furthermore, the “Growth Together” SBCC campaign, which promoted 13 core health, nutrition, sanitation, and hygiene practices, was fully incorporated into all intervention activities across the three intervention arms, meaning households receiving the higher intensity nutrition programming also encountered the associated SBCC sanitation messaging much more frequently than households in the sanitation-only arm. The SBCC campaign was also promoted nationally on television, such that households in the control arms may have been nearly as exposed to its content as sanitation-only households, while the nutrition-only and combined intervention arms received substantial in-person promotion of the SBCC campaign messaging.

                             Due to the nature of the interventions and resource considerations, all trial outcomes were assessed during a single survey round conducted 28 months after initiating the intervention programming, which introduced some limitations. Growth and pathogen outcomes were assessed in children from one to 28 months of age, meaning that older children received the treatments for a longer duration but were initially exposed to less mature intervention conditions than the younger children born later. The timing of outcome ascertainment also precluded detecting effects that may only be realized later in childhood, such as potentially rapid catch-up growth after 24 months of age that may reverse earlier growth faltering

We were limited by the suite of pathogen targets selected on our custom TAC assay; we selected these targets a priori based on a range of globally observed enteric pathogens, but we cannot know whether these were the most important enteric pathogens in rural Cambodia.

                             . It is highly plausible that this sanitation intervention simply failed to sufficiently reduce environmental exposure to enteric pathogens. For example, only 22% of households in our survey were observed to have a child play environment free of animals, with little difference between treatment and control arms; this is a transmission pathway that our trial and many other WASH trials have not addressed

                             . The trial design is predicated on the theory that gains in sanitation coverage may lead to improved growth outcomes in children via reductions in the transmission of enteric infection and disease, though links between sanitation coverage and specific outcomes are poorly understood in high-burden settings. The change in community coverage in this trial was limited and likely insufficient to reduce community exposure and transmission.

                             There are a few key observations from this study that should be considered in future interventions and effectiveness trials of comparable interventions. Increased frequency, duration, and intensity of CLTS programming could have resulted in greater uptake of sanitation in target communes. Despite the sanitation coverage gains observed in the sanitation-only arm, much of which may have been as a result of the sanitation intervention, we are unable to attribute beneficial effects—i.e., measurable differences in prespecified outcomes—to the sanitation intervention due to the high sanitation gains also observed in the control arm. There may have been other benefits of sanitation gains that were not measured, including in safety and broader measures of well-being
