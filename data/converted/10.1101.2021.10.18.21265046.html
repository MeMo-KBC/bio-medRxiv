  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Forecasting healthcare demand is essential in epidemic settings, both to inform situational awareness and facilitate resource planning. Ideally, forecasts should be robust across time and locations. During the COVID-19 pandemic in England, it is an ongoing concern that demand for hospital care for COVID-19 patients in England will exceed available resources.

Methods We made weekly forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital admissions for National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England between August 2020 and April 2021 using three disease-agnostic forecasting models: a mean ensemble of autoregressive time series models, a linear regression model with 7-day-lagged local cases as a predictor, and a scaled convolution of local cases and a delay distribution. We compared their point and probabilistic accuracy to a mean-ensemble of them all, and to a simple baseline model of no change from the last day of admissions. We measured predictive performance using the Weighted Interval Score (WIS) and considered how this changed in different scenarios (the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location), as well as how much admissions forecasts improved when future cases were known.

Results All models outperformed the baseline in the majority of scenarios. Forecasting accuracy varied by forecast date and location, depending on the trajectory of the outbreak, and all individual models had instances where they were the top- or bottom-ranked model. Forecasts produced by the mean-ensemble were both the most accurate and most consistently accurate forecasts amongst all the models considered. Forecasting accuracy was improved when using future observed, rather than forecast, cases, especially at longer forecast horizons.

Conclusions Assuming no change in current admissions is rarely better than including at least a trend. Using confirmed COVID-19 cases as a predictor can improve admissions forecasts in some scenarios, but this is variable and depends on the ability to make consistently good case forecasts. However, ensemble forecasts can make forecasts that make consistently more accurate forecasts across time and locations. Given minimal requirements on data and computation, our admissions forecasting ensemble could be used to anticipate healthcare needs in future epidemic or pandemic settings.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background Forecasting healthcare demand is essential in epidemic settings, both to inform situational awareness and facilitate resource planning. Ideally, forecasts should be robust across time and locations. During the COVID-19 pandemic in England, it is an ongoing concern that demand for hospital care for COVID-19 patients in England will exceed available resources.

Methods We made weekly forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital admissions for National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England between August 2020 and April 2021 using three disease-agnostic forecasting models: a mean ensemble of autoregressive time series models, a linear regression model with 7-day-lagged local cases as a predictor, and a scaled convolution of local cases and a delay distribution. We compared their point and probabilistic accuracy to a mean-ensemble of them all, and to a simple baseline model of no change from the last day of admissions. We measured predictive performance using the Weighted Interval Score (WIS) and considered how this changed in different scenarios (the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location), as well as how much admissions forecasts improved when future cases were known.

Results All models outperformed the baseline in the majority of scenarios. Forecasting accuracy varied by forecast date and location, depending on the trajectory of the outbreak, and all individual models had instances where they were the top- or bottom-ranked model. Forecasts produced by the mean-ensemble were both the most accurate and most consistently accurate forecasts amongst all the models considered. Forecasting accuracy was improved when using future observed, rather than forecast, cases, especially at longer forecast horizons.

Conclusions Assuming no change in current admissions is rarely better than including at least a trend. Using confirmed COVID-19 cases as a predictor can improve admissions forecasts in some scenarios, but this is variable and depends on the ability to make consistently good case forecasts. However, ensemble forecasts can make forecasts that make consistently more accurate forecasts across time and locations. Given minimal requirements on data and computation, our admissions forecasting ensemble could be used to anticipate healthcare needs in future epidemic or pandemic settings.

                              Forecasting healthcare demand is essential in epidemic settings, both to inform situational awareness and facilitate resource planning. Ideally, forecasts should be robust across time and locations. During the COVID-19 pandemic in England, it is an ongoing concern that demand for hospital care for COVID-19 patients in England will exceed available resources.

                              We made weekly forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital admissions for National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England between August 2020 and April 2021 using three disease-agnostic forecasting models: a mean ensemble of autoregressive time series models, a linear regression model with 7-day-lagged local cases as a predictor, and a scaled convolution of local cases and a delay distribution. We compared their point and probabilistic accuracy to a mean-ensemble of them all, and to a simple baseline model of no change from the last day of admissions. We measured predictive performance using the Weighted Interval Score (WIS) and considered how this changed in different scenarios (the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location), as well as how much admissions forecasts improved when future cases were known.

                              All models outperformed the baseline in the majority of scenarios. Forecasting accuracy varied by forecast date and location, depending on the trajectory of the outbreak, and all individual models had instances where they were the top- or bottom-ranked model. Forecasts produced by the mean-ensemble were both the most accurate and most consistently accurate forecasts amongst all the models considered. Forecasting accuracy was improved when using future observed, rather than forecast, cases, especially at longer forecast horizons.

                              Assuming no change in current admissions is rarely better than including at least a trend. Using confirmed COVID-19 cases as a predictor can improve admissions forecasts in some scenarios, but this is variable and depends on the ability to make consistently good case forecasts. However, ensemble forecasts can make forecasts that make consistently more accurate forecasts across time and locations. Given minimal requirements on data and computation, our admissions forecasting ensemble could be used to anticipate healthcare needs in future epidemic or pandemic settings.

                             ]). While national or regional forecasts provide a big-picture summary of the expected trajectory of COVID-19 activity, they can mask spatial heterogeneity that arises through localised interventions or demographic heterogeneity in the risk of exposure or severity [

                             In theory, future admissions are a function of recent cases in the community, the proportion of cases that require and seek health care (the case-hospitalisation rate (CHR)), and the delay from symptom onset to hospital admission. However, forecasting admissions from community cases is challenging as both the CHR and admission delay can vary over time. The CHR depends on testing effort and strategy (how many symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are identified), the age-distribution of cases [

                             ]. Forecasting studies have found that cases are predictive of admissions with a lag of only 4 - 7 days [

Besides structural challenges, models are subject to constraints of data availability in real-time and at the relevant spatial scale (by hospital or Trust (a small group of hospitals) for admissions, and local authority level for cases and other predictors).

                             Models need to be sufficiently flexible to capture a potentially wide range of epidemic behaviour across locations and time, but at the same time should produce results sufficiently rapidly to be updated in a reasonable amount of time. Autoregressive time series models are widely used in other forecasting tasks (e.g. [

                             One way to attempt improving the robustness of forecasts is to combine them into an ensemble forecast, whereby predictions from several different models are combined into a single forecast. This reduces reliance on a single forecasting model and, given a minimum quality of the constituent models, the average performance of ensembles is generally comparable, if not better than, its best constituent models [

                             In this paper, we make and evaluate weekly forecasts of daily hospital admissions at the level of NHS Trusts during the period August 2020 - April 2021, including two national lockdowns and the introduction and spread of the Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant. We assess the forecasting performance of three individual forecasting models and an ensemble of these models, and compare their performance to a naive baseline model that assumes no future change from current admissions. Forecasts are made using publicly available data on hospital admissions (by Trust) and COVID-19 cases (by upper-tier local authority (UTLA), a geographic region of England). For forecasting models that use forecast COVID-19 cases as a predictor, we consider the value of making perfect case forecasts.

To use UTLA-level cases to make forecasts of Trust-level hospital admissions, we needed to estimate cases at the Trust level too. We used a many-to-many mapping between UTLAs and NHS Trusts that is based on COVID-19 hospital admissions line list data for England. For each Trust-UTLA pair (t,u), the mapping reports the proportion p

We calculated total admissions as the sum of all admissions between 01 August 2020 and 30 April 2021 (inclusive).

We then used the complete-linkage clustering algorithm to divide Trusts into seven groups, matching the seven NHS regions in England.

                               In addition, we used three individual forecasting methods, plus two unweighted ensembles of these three models. The first of the three individual models was a mean-ensemble of three autoregressive time series models (autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing (ETS) and the baseline defined above) that use only past observed admissions data to forecast future admissions. The second model was a regression model with correlated (ARIMA) errors, with Trust-level cases lagged by d days as a predictor. This model uses past observed admissions and past estimated Trust-level cases (estimated via the Trust-UTLA mapping) for forecast horizon h ≤ d, plus forecast Trust-level cases (again, estimated via the Trust-UTLA mapping) for h > d, where the optimal value for d is chosen by optimising for forecasting performance. The third and final individual model is a convolution of estimated Trust-level cases with the delay from report to admission. This model uses past observed admissions and past and future Trust-level cases. None of the models include a day-of-the-week effect, as it was determined a priori that this was not a consistent feature of the Trust-level data. Further details of the three individual forecasting models can be found in Additional file 1: Section 2 [

                               For models that use forecasted COVID-19 cases to forecast hospital admissions, forecast performance is affected by both the structure of the admissions forecasting model and the quality of the case forecasts (which are made independently of the admissions forecasts and do not form part of this study). Models that use forecast cases to forecast admissions are the ARIMA regression for forecast horizon h > 7, and the convolution model and mean-ensemble for all forecast horizons. To evaluate the performance of the admissions models only, we conducted a retrospective study where the relevant models (noted above) used future observed, rather than forecast, COVID-19 cases to forecast hospital admissions; this represents a best-case scenario for these models, as using future observed cases throughout is equivalent to making a perfect case forecast with no uncertainty.

                               These retrospective forecasts were scored using the same metrics and scenarios as the real-time forecasts. We also directly compare each model’s performance using observed vs. forecast future COVID-19 cases, where we report the sWIS only.

                               The number of COVID-19 hospital admissions in England was very low at the start of August 2020: during the week 03 - 09 August 2020, national daily admissions ranged between 49 and 78. From early September onwards, admissions began to increase (

                               ), predominantly in the Midlands and North of England (Additional file 1: Figure S2). In response to rising cases and admissions, the UK Government introduced a three-tier system of restrictions throughout England on 14 October 2020; by the end of October all major northern cities (including Manchester and Liverpool) were under the strictest Tier 3 measures, and the majority of the rest of the North of England, plus the Midlands, London and parts of Essex were in Tier 2. A national lockdown was introduced from 05 November - 02 December 2020 and during this time admissions fell or plateaued in all NHS regions (Additional file 1: Figure S2). At the end of lockdown (03 December 2020), the majority of local authorities in England re-entered Tier 3, but hospital admissions continued to increase: national daily admissions increased from 1,178 on 02 December 2020, to 1,437 one week later (09 December 2020), and to 1,880 two weeks later (16 December 2020) - already exceeding the early-autumn peak of 1,620 daily admissions. On 19 December 2020 local authorities in the East and South East of England and all London boroughs entered into yet stricter Tier 4 restrictions, and on 06 January 2021 England was placed under the third national lockdown. National daily admissions peaked at 3,895 on 12 January 2021 and subsequently declined throughout January - April 2021. By the end of April, average national daily admissions were fewer than 100 (during the week 19 - 25 April 2021, median = 97, interquartile range (IQR) = 28).

The initial rollout was amongst care home residents, their carers and individuals aged 80 years and over, then subsequently to all aged 70 years and over and the clinically extremely vulnerable individuals (from 18 January 2021) and then all aged 65 years and over and adults with high-risk underlying health conditions (15 February 2021). By 30 April 2020, 63% and 27% of adults aged 16 and over had received the first and second dose of the vaccine, respectively [

Clusters of Trusts, defined by the pairwise correlation between admissions, clearly show some spatial clustering (reflecting the geographical spread of COVID-19 in England at the time) but are not constrained by the NHS region boundaries (Additional file 1: Figure S3C). Instead, clusters are defined by the occurrence and timing of peaks in admissions (Additional file 1: Figure S3D): for example, cluster 1 includes Trusts in London and the South East of England that had little or no peak in November 2020, while clusters 5-7 comprise Trusts in the North of England where admissions increased earlier and there are two distinct peaks in admissions in November 2020 and January 2021 (Additional file 1: Figure S3C-D). The variation in Trust-level dynamics could be driven by Trust capacity, local COVID-19 case incidence and demography (such as age), pre-existing immunity, and local and/or national restrictions.

                               Trust-level cases are estimated using the Trust-UTLA mapping. The accuracy of this mapping for a given Trust depends on a number of factors, including: the spatial distribution of cases until 30 September 2020; total admissions to the Trust until 30 September 2020; and the size of the Trust-UTLA mapping. Trusts admit COVID-19 patients from relatively few UTLAs (median = 3, IQR = 2; Additional file 1: Figure S3A), with a small minority of Trusts (typically in London or other large cities such as Birmingham and Manchester) admitting patients from more than 10 UTLAs. Trusts admit the majority of their COVID-19 patients from only 1-2 UTLAs (excluding UTLAs contributing less than 10% of admissions: median = 2, IQR = 1.8).

Although its constituent models are not particularly well-calibrated, the mean-ensemble still has comparatively good empirical coverage: for a 14-day horizon, it has empirical coverage of 0.46 and 0.76 for the 50% and 90% prediction intervals respectively.

The convolution model also saw notable improvements, especially for a 14-day forecast horizon (Additional file 1: Figure S7C). However, for both models there were still forecast dates where they were outperformed by the baseline, indicating that this poor performance was not linked to the case forecasts, but to another aspect of the models.

                               We also saw an improvement in performance (on average) when we evaluated forecasts by Trust (Additional file 1: Figure S7B and S7D). The 14-day-ahead forecasts made by the ARIMA regression model now outperformed the baseline model for 113/129 Trusts (compared to 102/129 previously; Additional file 1: Figure S7B). The convolution model now outperformed the baseline model for 123/129 Trusts for a 7-day horizon (compared to 116/129), and for 125/129 Trusts for a 14-day horizon (compared to only 81/129 previously; Additional file 1: Figure S7D).

The mean-ensemble performed consistently well across horizons, forecast dates and Trusts, and rarely (if ever) performed worse than the baseline. Conversely, both the ARIMA regression and case-convolution still encountered scenarios where they performed worse than the baseline, warranting further investigation.

                             We found that all models outperformed the baseline model in almost all scenarios, that is, assuming no change in current admissions was rarely better than including at least a trend. Moreover, models that included cases as a predictor of future admissions generally made better forecasts than purely autoregressive models. However, the utility of cases as a predictor for admissions is limited by the quality of case forecasts: while perfect case forecasts can improve forecasts of admissions, real-time case forecasts are not perfect and can lead to worse forecasts of admissions than simple trend-based models. Unfortunately, making accurate forecasts of COVID-19 cases in a rapidly-evolving epidemic is challenging [

                             We found that the prediction interval coverage of the ARIMA regression model was especially low, which inspires a number of areas for future work. One likely reason for this result is that this model uses only the median case forecast, ignoring uncertainty; future work could account for uncertainty of case forecasts (e.g. by using case forecast sample paths as the predictor) and evaluate how this changes the model’s performance. Other reasons for low coverage could be changes over time in the association between cases and admissions, that is, in the CHR or the delay to admission, both of which could occur when the case demographics change [

During an outbreak, time required to develop and improve forecasting models is limited and in competition with other objectives. When forecasting local-level hospital admissions in epidemic settings, assuming no change in admissions is rarely better than including at least a trend component; including a lagged predictor, such as cases, can further improve forecasting accuracy, but is dependent on making good case forecasts, especially for longer forecast horizons. Using a mean-ensemble overcomes some of the variable performance of individual models and allows us to make more accurate and more consistently accurate forecasts across time and locations.

                             Assuming no change in current admissions is rarely better than including at least a trend. Using confirmed COVID-19 cases as a predictor can improve admissions forecasts in some scenarios, but this is variable and depends on the ability to make consistently good case forecasts. However, ensemble forecasts can make consistently more accurate forecasts across time and locations. Given minimal requirements on data and computation, our admissions forecasting ensemble could be used to anticipate healthcare needs in future epidemic or pandemic settings.
