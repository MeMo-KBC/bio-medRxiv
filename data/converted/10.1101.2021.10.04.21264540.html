<p>Detailed reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and assessment of its burden in several parts of the world has still remained largely unknown due to the scarcity of epidemiological analyses and limited testing capacities of different countries to identify cases and deaths attributable to COVID-19 [1-4]. Understanding the true burden of the Iranian COVID-19 epidemic is subject to similar challenges with limited clinical and epidemiological studies at the subnational level [5-9]. To address this, we develop a new quantitative framework that enables us to fully reconstruct the transmission dynamics across the country and assess the level of under-reporting in infections and deaths using province-level, age-stratified all-cause mortality data. We show that excess mortality aligns with seroprevalence estimates in each province and subsequently estimate that as of 2021-10-22, only 48% (95% confidence interval: 43-55%) of COVID-19 deaths in Iran have been reported. We find that in the most affected provinces such as East Azerbaijan, Qazvin, and Qom approximately 0.4% of the population have died of COVID-19 so far. We also find significant heterogeneity in the estimated attack rates across the country with 11 provinces reaching close to or higher than 100% attack rates. Despite a relatively young age structure in Iran, our analysis reveals that the infection fatality rate in most provinces is comparable to high-income countries with a larger percentage of older adults, suggesting that limited access to medical services, coupled with undercounting of COVID-19-related deaths, can have a significant impact on accurate estimation of COVID-19 fatalities.

Our estimation of high attack rates in provinces with largely unmitigated epidemics whereby, on average, between 10% to 25% individuals have been infected with COVID-19 at least twice over the course of 20 months also suggests that, despite several waves of infection, herd immunity through natural infection has not been achieved in the population.

  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Detailed reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and assessment of its burden in several parts of the world has still remained largely unknown due to the scarcity of epidemiological analyses and limited testing capacities of different countries to identify cases and deaths attributable to COVID-19 [[1][1]-[4][2]]. Understanding the true burden of the Iranian COVID-19 epidemic is subject to similar challenges with limited clinical and epidemiological studies at the subnational level [[5][3]-[9][4]]. To address this, we develop a new quantitative framework that enables us to fully reconstruct the transmission dynamics across the country and assess the level of under-reporting in infections and deaths using province-level, age-stratified all-cause mortality data. We show that excess mortality aligns with seroprevalence estimates in each province and subsequently estimate that as of 2021-10-22, only 48% (95% confidence interval: 43-55%) of COVID-19 deaths in Iran have been reported. We find that in the most affected provinces such as East Azerbaijan, Qazvin, and Qom approximately 0.4% of the population have died of COVID-19 so far. We also find significant heterogeneity in the estimated attack rates across the country with 11 provinces reaching close to or higher than 100% attack rates. Despite a relatively young age structure in Iran, our analysis reveals that the infection fatality rate in most provinces is comparable to high-income countries with a larger percentage of older adults, suggesting that limited access to medical services, coupled with undercounting of COVID-19-related deaths, can have a significant impact on accurate estimation of COVID-19 fatalities. Our estimation of high attack rates in provinces with largely unmitigated epidemics whereby, on average, between 10% to 25% individuals have been infected with COVID-19 at least twice over the course of 20 months also suggests that, despite several waves of infection, herd immunity through natural infection has not been achieved in the population.

                             Detailed reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and assessment of its burden in several parts of the world has still remained largely unknown due to the scarcity of epidemiological analyses and limited testing capacities of different countries to identify cases and deaths attributable to COVID-19 [

                             ]. Understanding the true burden of the Iranian COVID-19 epidemic is subject to similar challenges with limited clinical and epidemiological studies at the subnational level [

                             ]. To address this, we develop a new quantitative framework that enables us to fully reconstruct the transmission dynamics across the country and assess the level of under-reporting in infections and deaths using province-level, age-stratified all-cause mortality data. We show that excess mortality aligns with seroprevalence estimates in each province and subsequently estimate that as of 2021-10-22, only 48% (95% confidence interval: 43-55%) of COVID-19 deaths in Iran have been reported. We find that in the most affected provinces such as East Azerbaijan, Qazvin, and Qom approximately 0.4% of the population have died of COVID-19 so far. We also find significant heterogeneity in the estimated attack rates across the country with 11 provinces reaching close to or higher than 100% attack rates. Despite a relatively young age structure in Iran, our analysis reveals that the infection fatality rate in most provinces is comparable to high-income countries with a larger percentage of older adults, suggesting that limited access to medical services, coupled with undercounting of COVID-19-related deaths, can have a significant impact on accurate estimation of COVID-19 fatalities. Our estimation of high attack rates in provinces with largely unmitigated epidemics whereby, on average, between 10% to 25% individuals have been infected with COVID-19 at least twice over the course of 20 months also suggests that, despite several waves of infection, herd immunity through natural infection has not been achieved in the population.

                             Assessing the true burden of COVID-19 requires a comprehensive surveillance system to monitor outbreaks and a large capacity for diagnostic testing. However, this is particularly challenging for many low- and middle-income countries due to limited diagnostic capacities and access to healthcare [

                             ]. An alternative approach to measuring the burden of COVID-19 is to monitor changes in all-cause mortality trends with respect to baseline levels based on historic trends (i.e., measuring excess mortality). While excess mortality during the current pandemic may not exactly match the true number of COVID-19-related deaths due to various reasons such as disruptions in treatment for other fatal diseases and socio-economic disparities in health care in different regions of a country, several works have shown that a significant portion of excess deaths in many countries are directly attributable to COVID-19 [

                             ]. It was also one of the first countries to experience a second wave of infection after the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in July 2020 [

                             ]. Since then, the country experienced three additional waves, two of which were driven by the Alpha and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2, in May and September 2021. Despite a recent increase in the number of daily administered vaccine doses, Iran had a very slow start on its immunisation programme with only ∼3% of the population being fully vaccinated by the end of July 2021, during the surge in cases with the Delta variant [

                             ]. Because the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) of Iran stopped releasing province-level data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from 2020-03-22, the transmission dynamics across the country have remained largely unknown. One way to estimate the number of infections and account for under-reporting of cases is by converting deaths attributable to COVID-19 to infections using a population-weighted infection fatality ratio (IFR) estimate (i.e., infections = deaths / IFR), taking into account the demographics of the population of interest [
                             <a id="xref-ref-21-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21">

                             ]. However, such estimation of attack rates can be inaccurate or misleading if it does not take into account the impact of limited access to health care in municipalities with low socioeconomic status, uneven adoption of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical intervention in different areas, and the increased chance of re-infection over time. Neglecting to account for these factors can result in an overestimate of SARS-CoV-2 attack rates and underestimation its potential for continued transmission, with immediate implications for assessments of the potential burden of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as Omicron in a population. In this work, we use the newly updated province-level age-stratified weekly all-cause mortality data from the National Organization for Civil Registration (NOCR) of Iran and develop a mathematical framework to fully reconstruct the Iranian epidemic with the aim to estimate the attack rate, number of daily hospital admissions, deaths, and re-infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 across the country.

                             shows 5 distinct peaks in excess mortality with a temporal trend that is strongly associated with the nationwide reported COVID-19 deaths over time. Several provinces show significant levels of excess mortality from the first week of February 2020 suggesting that the Iranian epidemic likely started at least a month before that (

However, this dropped to 2.1 at the later stages suggesting that the testing capacity of the country to record infections and deaths gradually improved over time, but not to the extent to fully capture the majority of COVID-19-related deaths. This is also in agreement with statements from the Iranian health officials suggesting that Iran’s COVID-19-related deaths could be twice the official numbers and also previous studies showing elevated levels of under-reporting of COVID-19 fatalities in Iran, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic [

During the first wave in spring 2020, only a few provinces showed significant levels of excess mortality with Gilan, Qom, Mazandaran, and Golestan among the hardest-hit provinces. This is likely because these provinces usually attract a large number of tourists and pilgrims around the New Year’s holiday in February/March which led to large superspreading events and uncontrolled outbreaks due to limited NPIs before the national lockdown on 2020-03-05 [

While we see a gradual increase in the ratio of deaths in the older age-groups during the first three waves, there is a two-fold drop in the 60-74 and 75+ age-groups before the start of the fifth wave. This is likely due to a higher vaccination coverage in these age-groups.

This enables us to reconstruct the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics across the country and infer the population fatality rate (PFR), IFR, and attack rate per province (see Methods section). We first estimate the national and provincial attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 under two different set of assumptions of the IFR by age relationship and select the better-fitting model by comparing the modelled seroprevalence estimates to data (

We find that the model with a higher IFR per age-group (and an overall lower estimated attack rate) that explicitly accounts for an increase in IFR when hospital capacity is reached (see Methods section) provides a better fit to seroprevalence data. With a median value of approximately 0.50% (0.32-0.64%), our inferred province-level IFR is roughly twice as high as the population-weighted IFR, which is calculated using age-specific IFR estimates derived from serological studies in predominantly high-income countries (

                             ). There is also a strong association between the modelled and observed daily hospital admissions over time and across provinces, further indicating that the majority of excess deaths during the pandemic period are directly attributable to COVID-19 (

                             ). There is, however, a notably lower number of modelled daily hospital admissions compared to observed hospitalisations in some provinces (e.g., South Khorasan, Lorestan, and Yazd) during the last wave in comparison to earlier waves. To explore these patterns, we use a mixed-effects model to examine the relationship between the number of hospitalisations inferred from our model fits and the observed confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions over time and across epidemic waves while controlling for province-specific variation (see Methods section). Using this framework, we show that there was no significant decrease in the ratio of model inferred hospitalisations to observed hospitalisations during the last wave compared to previous waves, and that the majority of variation in hospitalisation patterns observed is explained by province-level random effects, most likely due to specific changes in treatment seeking or the age demographics being most affected in later waves (

                             ). However, a significant decrease in the ratio of model inferred hospitalisations to observed hospitalisations was observed since the start of the pandemic, which suggests that case fatality rates from hospitalised infections have decreased during this period, likely due to a combination of improved case management, increased number of infections resulting from reinfections, and higher vaccination coverage.

This study is the first to formally explore the suitability of excess mortality as a proxy for estimating under-reporting of COVID-19 infections and deaths, confirming the information contained within reliable excess mortality statistics through the broad agreement with representative seroprevalence estimates. Additionally, this analysis lends further support to evidence that IFR patterns estimated in high income countries may underestimate the IFR in settings with stretched healthcare capacity [

Even though in some provinces we find that the transmission model with a lower estimated IFR provides a better fit to seroprevalence estimates, such a model offers a poor fit across most provinces and often results in epidemiologically unrealistic outcomes such that the modelled transmission dynamics outruns the pool of susceptible individuals. We also note that while some factors such as misidentification of baseline all-cause mortality and deaths attributable to COVID-19, particularly in the younger age-groups with fewer COVID-19-related deaths, can contribute to varied attack rates in some provinces, other factors such as nonrepresentative serosurveys, varied time to seroreversion using different assays, and uncertainty in inferring the true contact matrix between different age-groups within the population can impact the inferred attack rates [

                             Prior to the emergence of the variants of concern, the basic reproduction number of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was estimated to be around 2.8 which corresponds to a herd immunity threshold of about 64% [

During unmitigated outbreaks with such reproduction numbers, the attack rate can reach as high as 90% [

While the duration of antibody responses after coronavirus infection over longer timescales remains largely unknown, recent surveillance data and comparative studies have shown that re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 is possible after 3-6 months, and that older age-groups have a much lower protection against reinfection [

                             ]. Our findings of high attack rates in several provinces show that herd immunity through natural infection has not been achieved in the population even after nearly 20 months since the start of the Iranian epidemic. This is likely due to substantial reduction in protection against repeat infection over time either due to waning immunity, increased chance of re-infection with variants of concern, or a combination of both. We note that while systematic biases such as identifying the baseline level of all-cause mortality and overestimation of deaths attributable to COVID-19, particularly in the younger age-groups, can contribute to increased attack rates in some provinces, other factors such as heterogeneities in immune protection, limited access to health care in municipalities with low socioeconomic status, and uneven adoption of public health intervention in different regions can also contribute to varied attack rates across the country.

As a result, we used multiple data sources to approximate the roll of vaccines subnationally.

A mix of vaccine types have been administered in Iran, with 80% of the population vaccinated with Sinopharm, 10% with AZ and the remaining 10% either Sputkink-V (1.5%) and CoViran Barekat (8.5%). Due to the mix of vaccine types with uncertain efficacy estimates, particularly related to Delta, we use vaccine efficacy estimates for first and second dose efficacy sourced from estimates for the Sinopharm vaccine and other inactivated whole virus vaccine platforms (

                              ). Efficacy estimates are weighted to produce an overall population efficacy by the proportion of vaccinated individuals who have received either a first dose or second dose, and by the assumed proportion of the Delta variant in the population, sourced from the sampling dates of Delta sequences in Iran from GISAID (gisaid.org), lagged by 14 days to reflect the delay from administering vaccine to protection being conferred.

                              To estimate the attack rate over time, we explore three sets of model assumptions, which scan across the likely range of parameter estimates for key model parameters that impact the attack rate inferred. These parameters relate to the assumed number of general and ICU hospital beds available, the change in hospitalisation related to the Delta variant and the level of immune escape conferred by the Delta variant relative to previous infection by the Alpha variant and the original wild type strains. These ranges are described in

                               We have now updated our results to include a compartmental SEIR model to fit the excess mortality data rather than using excess mortality directly to estimate national and subnational attack rates. In this version, we have removed some of the old analysis on using age-stratified IFR to calculate attack rates per age-group. Therefore, we have modified attack rate estimates (now included in the revised figure 2, table 1, supplementary table 1, and supplementary figures) as well as reinfection rate estimates (now included in figure 2). The supplementary files have also been updated.
