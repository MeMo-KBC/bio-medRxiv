  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Depression is a treatable disease, and untreated depression can lead to serious health complications and decrease the quality of life. Therefore, prevention, early identification, and treatment efforts are essential. Screening has an essential role in preventive medicine in the general population. Ideally, screening tools detect patients early enough to manage the disease and reduce symptoms. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of routine screening schedules.

Methods We used a discrete-time nonstationary Markov model to simulate the progression of depression. We used Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the stochastic model for 20 years or during the lifetime of individuals. Baseline and screening scenario models with screening frequencies of annual, 2-year, and 5-year strategies were compared based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and one-way sensitivity analysis were conducted to manage uncertainties.

Results In the general population, all screening strategies were cost-effective compared to the baseline. However, male and female populations differed based on cost over quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Females had lower ICERs, and annual screening had the highest ICER for females, with 11,134$/QALY gained. In contrast, males had around three times higher ICER, with annual screening costs of 34,065$/QALY gained.

Limitations We assumed that the screening frequency was not changing at any time during the screening scenario. In our calculations, false-positive cases were not taking into account.

Conclusions Considering the high lifetime prevalence and recurrence rates of depression, detection and prevention efforts can be one critical cornerstone to support required care. Our analysis combined the expected benefits and costs of screening and assessed the effectiveness of screening scenarios. We conclude that routine screening is cost-effective for all age groups of females and young, middle-aged males.

However, male and female populations differed based on cost over quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Females had lower ICERs, and annual screening had the highest ICER for females, with 11,134$/QALY gained. In contrast, males had around three times higher ICER, with annual screening costs of 34,065$/QALY gained.

Limitations We assumed that the screening frequency was not changing at any time during the screening scenario. In our calculations, false-positive cases were not taking into account.

Conclusions Considering the high lifetime prevalence and recurrence rates of depression, detection and prevention efforts can be one critical cornerstone to support required care. Our analysis combined the expected benefits and costs of screening and assessed the effectiveness of screening scenarios. We conclude that routine screening is cost-effective for all age groups of females and young, middle-aged males.

                              Depression is a treatable disease, and untreated depression can lead to serious health complications and decrease the quality of life. Therefore, prevention, early identification, and treatment efforts are essential. Screening has an essential role in preventive medicine in the general population. Ideally, screening tools detect patients early enough to manage the disease and reduce symptoms. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of routine screening schedules.

                              We used a discrete-time nonstationary Markov model to simulate the progression of depression. We used Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the stochastic model for 20 years or during the lifetime of individuals. Baseline and screening scenario models with screening frequencies of annual, 2-year, and 5-year strategies were compared based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and one-way sensitivity analysis were conducted to manage uncertainties.

                              In the general population, all screening strategies were cost-effective compared to the baseline. However, male and female populations differed based on cost over quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Females had lower ICERs, and annual screening had the highest ICER for females, with 11,134$/QALY gained. In contrast, males had around three times higher ICER, with annual screening costs of 34,065$/QALY gained.

                              Considering the high lifetime prevalence and recurrence rates of depression, detection and prevention efforts can be one critical cornerstone to support required care. Our analysis combined the expected benefits and costs of screening and assessed the effectiveness of screening scenarios. We conclude that routine screening is cost-effective for all age groups of females and young, middle-aged males.

Both major depression and minor depression present with either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities along with other symptoms, and the signs are present for two weeks or longer. Minor depression, with a few mild symptoms, can be resolved without treatment, but it may evolve into major depression. Major depression with moderate or severe symptoms significantly impacts life quality and may require treatment from a mental health specialist. However, most depression cases are treated in general medical settings in practice (

Between 1999 and 2019, suicide rates, whether with an underlying diagnosis of depression or not, increased by 33% in the overall population (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).

                             Depression co-occurs highly with other physical illnesses, which causes health and economic burdens to individuals and society. It is estimated that depression cost $210 billion in 2010, including direct and indirect costs (e.g., loss of productivity) (

                             ). Considering high prevalence and low detection rates, improved management of disease may reduce health spending and improve patients ‘ quality and quantity of life. Due to the high cost and the negative impacts on patients ‘ overall health, improved detection efforts may be adopted by policymakers and healthcare agencies.

                             Routine depression screening can be used to improve the recognition of depressive episodes. In some health systems, screening is commonly used; in other settings, implementation is limited (

                             The frequency of screening of the general population in different health settings is uncertain. Therefore, evaluation of medical benefits (e.g., decrease the recurrence, relapses, improve treatment success and increase the symptom-free days) and costs of routine depression screening strategies remain essential. In this study, we aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of routine screening schedules. We assessed the various routine screening frequencies for the general population and specific age groups of females and males.

For screening scenarii, we assumed that the screening tool could increase the probability of patients to diagnosis. We used Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the stochastic model for 20 years or during the lifetime of individuals. Since depression treatment generates long-term benefits, we modeled for a 20-year time horizon, similar to others in the literature (Mark T. Linthicum et al., 2016;

                             Annual screening of all adults 18 years old or older for depression would be $11,134 and $34,072 cost per QALY gained for females and males, respectively. In comparison, screening every 5-years resulted in $8627 cost per QALY gained for females and $26,892 cost per QALY gained for males. We found that the benefit of early detection and treatment results in the improvement of QALYs. For both genders, annual screening produced greater costs. The ICER decreased with increasing screening frequency for males, whereas it rose from 2-year to 5-year screening in the female population.

                             In the literature, the combined results from trials showed that depression screening increased the treatment rates between 2 to 50% (

                             ). In our model, patients spent an average of 3.65 years to initiate treatment for first-onset major depression. The World Health Organization ‘s (WHO ‘s) World Mental Health Survey showed that 35% of patients had 4 years of untreated time before initiating the treatment (

                             Based on the general intuition, depression treatments could help to improve patient ‘s mood and depressive symptoms. However, some studies showed that 10% to 30% of patients experienced adverse outcomes from treatments (e.g., antidepressants) such as functional impairment, poor quality of life (

                             ). Therefore, we chose conservative estimates for utilities. For example, we assumed that the utility of major depression with and without treatment was the same. Consequently, our results were not biased towards screening.

                             The age-specific analysis showed that screening of old populations had higher ICERs than the young and middle age groups. In the old male population, ICERs of all screening scenarii were below the WTP threshold of $50,000. The main reason for gender differences in the cost-effectiveness of screening was the varying incidence and prevalence of major depression. In literature, men had lower incidence rates than women (

                             ), although there is concern that these rates were not reflecting the truth (

                             ). There were a couple of factors that may cause the underestimation of the rates for males. Firstly, the measurement bias was observed in data because of the inadequate attendance to surveys and lower primary care visits (

                             ). Secondly, men were less likely than women to have symptoms of depression that fit standard measurement tools. They experienced more externalizing symptoms, such as aggression, violence, and substance abuse. Studies showed that including these alternative symptoms with traditional symptoms as diagnosis criteria had increased the male prevalence rates to have equal proportions with females (

                             We evaluated the external consistency of our model. By running the open network model for a longer time, where new individuals were introduced into the system at the age of 18 with the mortality rate, we observed that our initial distribution was equal to steady-state distribution. This was the case when transient behavior was not observed in the system. To obtain a consistent system, we adjusted the lifetime prevalence of major depression using reported recall bias rates (

                             Interventions (e.g., training primary care physicians to better identify patients with suicidal thoughts) that have an immediate cost but have gains observed during many years were less cost-effective under discounting. For interventions like screening, the costs and health benefits follow the same time pattern so are all affected equally by the discount factor, and the relative ICER comparisons between policies are unchanged, regardless of the discounting (

We also find that the relative ICER comparisons between policies continue to hold, such as the cost-effectiveness of the screening for the general adult population, 2-year screening ICER is less (more) than 5-year screening ICER for females (males). Therefore, we did not include the discount rate of utilities and costs in the body of the paper.

Our results indicated that the depression screening is cost-saving for females at 2 and 5-year screening frequencies and around $11,000 to $15,000 ICERs for males based on the screening interval between 2020 to 2040 (please see Supplementary file).

Because of incidence, disease progression, and suicide rate difference between females and males, we only considered the gender-specific model. We also extended our analysis for different age groups.

But distinct from their work, we used more detailed remission states, e.g., partial and full remission from different types of depression. We did not consider the medication costs that arose when patients were in remission. In the annual transition model, patients spent at least one year in treatment when they transition to treatment states, which is more than suggested acute therapy (6-12 weeks) and continuation therapy (4-8 months). We assumed that patients in partial remission with residual symptoms had received maintenance treatment.

                             Depression is a common health condition that affects an individual ‘s everyday life. Considering the high lifetime prevalence and recurrence rates of depression, detection and prevention efforts play an essential role. Furthermore, the increasing trend in suicide rates becomes an emerging public health problem. We conclude that routine screening is cost-effective for all age groups of females and young and middle-aged males. Male population results are sensitive to the higher costs of screening, which indicates that if the screening cost is 44% higher than the average cost, the screening of the male population is not cost-effective. Our analysis combines the expected benefits and costs of screening and assesses the effectiveness of screening scenarii. Screening can be one of the cornerstones to support required care. Our baseline model could be used to evaluate the potential consequences of medication strategies or alternative intervention scenarii.
