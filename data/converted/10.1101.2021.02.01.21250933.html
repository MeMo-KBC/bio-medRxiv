                              Heart failure (HF) is a complex syndrome associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Electronic health records (EHRs) are widely used to identify patients with HF. Despite the development of many HF phenotyping algorithms, it is unclear if the characteristics of identified populations reflect the known spectrum of disease in HF patients.

                              We performed a systematic evidence review to assess the methods used for HF algorithm development from US based data sources and the relevant information facilitating their application to research and clinical care. We queried PubMed for articles published up to November 2021. Out of 428 studies screened, 35 articles were included for primary analysis and 23 studies using only International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes were evaluated for secondary analysis. Results are reported descriptively.

                              HF algorithms were most often developed at academic medical centers, though these were not evenly distributed across the US. HF and congestive HF were the most frequent labels for observed phenotypes. Diagnoses were the most common data type used to identify HF patients and echocardiography was the second most frequent. Most studies used rule-based algorithms. Validation of algorithms varied considerably with 36% of HF subtype algorithms validated and 67% of acute HF algorithms validated. Demographics of any study population were reported in 57% of algorithm studies and 70% of ICD-only studies, however fewer than half (40% of algorithm and 46% of ICD-only) of studies reported demographics of the HF population identified by their computable phenotype. Of those reporting, most identified majority (>50%) male populations, including both algorithms for HF with preserved ejection fraction identified in this study.

                               Conclusion
                              </strong>
                              There is significant heterogeneity in phenotyping algorithms used to ascertain HF from EHRs. Validation of algorithms is inconsistent and largely relies on manual review of medical records. The concentration of algorithm development at a few sites limits their generalizability to identify HF patients in other settings. Differences between the reported demographics of algorithm-identified HF populations and those expected based on HF epidemiology suggest that current algorithms do not reflect the full spectrum of HF in the general population.

                             EHR data are heterogeneous, with differences in both patient populations and data structures making it non-trivial to create robust and reproducible EHR phenotypes. This has limited the scale and portability of phenotyping algorithms

                             However, it remains unclear whether populations identified by existing EHR algorithms represent the full spectrum of HF in the general population. Furthermore, when evaluating individual algorithms it can be difficult to understand what type(s) of HF patients are being captured, thereby limiting the ability to determine if the results can be generalized to other populations, essential information for evaluating any evidence generated from these patient groups.

                             we performed a systematic evidence review to evaluate how HF phenotypes are identified from the EHR and reported in the literature. We discuss active difficulties in the phenomics literature of HF. We compare these EHR algorithms and their component parts. We also assess their utility for research and clinical application, by comparing characteristics of algorithm defined populations to the general population. We show that for HF phenomics to benefit all HF patients, we need to carefully consider both the context, context, and results of EHR phenotype algorithms.

First we extracted information about the focus of the article (i.e., algorithm method development, applied study, or portability of previously published algorithm method) defining applied studies to be those where the primary purpose of the paper was to investigate a scientific question or describe a clinical application, rather than developing an algorithm to identify HF patients. We also extracted the label used by the author for all eligible phenotypes (e.g., “congestive heart failure”, “acute congestive heart failure”, and “heart failure” were all considered to be different phenotypes). Discordance between reviewers’ responses were resolved through discussion or by author LKW or JRM as a third reviewer. Next, we extracted additional information about each study and algorithm into custom forms. Data extraction focused on identifying study details (e.g., study data source, type of applied study, etc.), algorithm methodology (e.g., type of data, type of computational method, etc.), algorithm validation (e.g., type of validation, criteria for determining HF during manual review, etc.), and algorithm generalizability (e.g., demographics reporting, etc.). For papers that reported development of algorithm/s for multiple phenotypes we extracted algorithm specific information independently for each qualifying phenotype. Neither quality assessment nor risk of bias were assessed for the included studies, as there is no validated instrument for these types of studies.

To understand the relationship between algorithm-identified HF populations and those identified using only ICD diagnosis codes, we also performed a minimal data extraction on studies excluded in the full text review as ICD code only. This limited analysis extracted the type of study, ICD-only phenotypes, whether the ICD definition was validated, and demographic information (sex, age, race/ethnicity) for the population identified by the algorithm where available.

                              To better understand how studies identified HF populations from EHRs we assessed the types of data and methods applied across the 43 algorithm identified phenotypes.The majority of phenotype algorithms (91%, N = 39) used two or more different types of data to identify HF patients. Diagnoses were the most common data type used across algorithms (93%, N = 40). Of those algorithms using diagnoses, 73% used them alone (N = 29) or in combination with SNOMED or other terminologies (20%, N = 8). Echocardiography data - either the presence of a report or extracted ejection fraction values - were the second most frequent data type (58%, N = 25) and were used in 39% of algorithms detecting HF (N = 9), 93% of algorithms detecting HF subtypes (N = 13), and 50% of algorithms detecting acute HF (N = 3).

                              reports the frequency of algorithm and study types presented in each type of journal. We further classified each applied study by all of the application domains (i.e., clinical evidence, clinical operations, epidemiology, prediction modeling, other, plus any combination). The most common applied study type was prediction modeling (N = 19). The most frequent combination was prediction modeling applied to clinical operations (e.g., creating dashboard, clinical decision support, etc.) (N = 6), with all of these studies using ICD only definitions of HF and the majority publishing in informatics journals (N = 5).

                              Among computed phenotypes for HF we also considered whether algorithm, ICD only, or validation status differed by study or publication type. About half of HF algorithms were published in clinical journals (52%, N = 12), while a larger majority of acute HF (83%, N = 5) and HF subtype (93%, N = 13) algorithms were published in clinical journals. Within informatics journals the two algorithms identifying acute HF and HF subtypes were both part of method development papers. Within clinical journals the type of study (e.g., method development vs. applied) was predominantly applied within acute HF (N = 4 Applied, N = 1 Method Development) and predominantly methods development within HF subtype (N = 5 Applied, N = 8 Method Development) algorithms. All HF subtype algorithms used in applied studies (N = 5) were used for a combination of clinical evidence, prediction modeling and epidemiology, while all HF algorithms used in applied studies published in informatics journals (N = 4) were used for prediction modeling.

                              Understanding the population captured by an algorithm is essential to evaluating its generalizability. Therefore, we investigated which demographics were reported by each study. Demographics of any study population (not necessarily the identified HF population) were provided in only 57% (N = 20) of algorithm studies and 70% (N = 16) of ICD only studies. Regardless of HF identification approach, reporting study demographics was more common among studies published in clinical journals (Algorithm: 59%, N = 13; ICD Only: 85%, N = 11) compared to informatics journals (Algorithm: 54%, N = 7; ICD Only: 50%, N = 5).

                             Our results demonstrate that while EHR-based phenotyping of HF has been an active area of research for many years, it remains an open area with multiple unexplored domains. HF phenomics dates back more than a decade, and has produced at least one published method development focused algorithm every year since 2012. There appears to be an opportunity to identify more complex phenotypes as the majority of identified algorithms detected all-cause HF (e.g., with a minority identifying specific HF subtypes or acute HF events. However even within all-cause HF, there remains significant heterogeneity in the types of data used across algorithms, suggesting that even broadscale patient identification is not yet a settled task. Finally, although prediction modeling was a common application domain for HF populations, few of the identified studies actually used machine learning within their phenotyping algorithms. It is unclear whether this finding is due to limitations of our search strategy, a reflection of positive publication bias (e.g., machine learning methods have been applied, but performed poorly and were not published), or a true gap in the literature.

                             Nevertheless, investigation of machine learning algorithms may present a rich opportunity for HF phenomics research.

                             Another area of potential investigation is in the utility of HF algorithm performance for research and clinical applications, though this effort was hampered by the moderate rates of algorithm validation. Although one can use the logical combination of data types in algorithms to infer the patient population identified, validation serves an important role in tuning algorithm performance to the types of levels of evidence used during chart review to create a gold-standard case label. Just as clinical trial inclusion/exclusion criteria affect the generalizability of findings to the clinic, the phenotype definition used during validation determines whether an algorithm is fit for a particular analytic purpose. Positively, the majority of studies performing validation included the phenotype definition used during chart review. Interestingly, two used clinical trial definitions, which suggests the potential utility of these algorithms to demonstrate generalizability of trial findings in EHR populations.

                             Investigators seeking to apply published algorithms should pay close attention to the phenotype definition used during validation to determine if the identified population is appropriate for the intended analysis.

                             We also considered whether the populations identified by published HF algorithms capture the full spectrum of HF patients. We see significant potential for selection bias given the reliance on echocardiography by the majority of algorithms. For example, some studies labeled the phenotype they were capturing as “Heart failure”, but required an EF <40 in the algorithm meaning that the algorithm could actually only identify reduced EF heart failure. Furthermore, the majority of algorithms were developed at tertiary care academic medical centers where providers often rely on outside reports of ejection fraction measurements. These outside reports are rarely integrated into clinical data warehouses potentially affecting performance of algorithms across institutions. Therefore, it is possible that a number of HF patients are not being captured by these algorithms. Similarly, the concentration of algorithm development within a single state (Minnesota) and even a single institution (Mayo Clinic) or in institutions with non-representative populations (e.g., VA) limits the generalizability of these algorithms to community clinics and populations in underrepresented regions. As expected, algorithms developed at institutions in low-diversity geographic regions identify majority white populations, while the VA identified nearly 100% male populations. However even after accounting for these expected deviations, there remains stark differences from demographics expectations, with only two algorithm and one ICD studies identifying majority female populations despite the prevalence of HF in the United States being majority female (52%).

                             Large scale projects like the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute’s HeartShare program should be particularly mindful of these concerns to ensure all HF patients benefit from their phenomics investment.

                             Our study also shines light on potential challenges in dissemination and implementation of HF phenomics. First, we were surprised to find the majority of complex phenotypes published in clinical journals. Existing reviews of phenotyping methodology have focused solely on informatics and computer science journals,

                             an approach which our findings suggest may miss a number of complex algorithms. Similarly we expected more applied studies to be published in clinical journals, whereas our findings show the majority were published in informatics journals. We also noticed important trends in terms of the use of algorithms vs. ICD only definitions across application domains. In areas where codes are more commonly used (e.g., claims data), or where HF was not the primary interest area (e.g., computer science development with an HF application) we saw more applied studies using ICD only HF definitions. However, we see a potential concern for implementation of clinical evidence created using HF phenomics: although most clinical evidence studies used algorithms, the majority of clinical operations studies (e.g., clinical decision support or dashboard operations) used ICD only definitions. It will be critical to ensure alignment between the patient populations used to develop treatment guidelines and those for whom EHRs can implement practice guidance.

                             This study also identified significant areas of opportunity for the field to improve the rigor and reproducibility of both algorithm development and the reporting of algorithm-based studies. Our investigative team with decades of combined experience in EHR-based phenotyping were unable to fully identify the data sources, methods used, or validation status for five algorithms. A third of algorithm-based studies and nearly half of ICD only studies reported no demographics for any population in the paper. While publishing the demographics of algorithm identified populations has not historically been expected, the lack of reporting limits the ability to determine the potential generalizability of the algorithms. Especially with a phenotype as complex as HF, demographics provide important insight into the specific subpopulations that an algorithm may be preferentially identifying.

                             A major strength of this study is the unbiased manner by which we identified papers containing HF algorithms.

                             However, we used an interactive process with feedback and positive controls from the full author group to ensure relevant papers were included. Additionally, while assessing the risk of bias or study quality is an essential component of SERs, no tool currently exists to measure the risk of bias for EHR phenotyping algorithm studies. In absence of such a framework, we are unable to assess the risk of bias or quality of the included literature beyond noting the poor reporting of basic study information (e.g., where the population is derived).

                             In conclusion, we have completed the first systematic evidence review of computational phenotyping in HF. Overall our data suggest that current EHR identified HF populations do not reflect the full spectrum of HF phenotypes or patient populations. We also found significant room for improvement in reporting of HF phenotyping algorithms and study populations. There appears to be significant opportunities to advance the field of HF phenomics in both phenotypic and algorithm complexity moving forward.
