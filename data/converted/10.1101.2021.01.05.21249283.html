  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Substantial research is underway to develop next-generation interventions that address current malaria control challenges. As there is limited testing in their early development, it is difficult to predefine intervention properties such as efficacy that achieve target health goals, and therefore challenging to prioritize selection of novel candidate interventions. Here, we present a quantitative approach to guide intervention development using mathematical models of malaria dynamics coupled with machine learning. Our analysis identifies requirements of efficacy, coverage, and duration of effect for five novel malaria interventions to achieve targeted reductions in malaria prevalence. This study highlights the role of mathematical models to support intervention development.

Methods A mathematical model of malaria transmission dynamics is used to simulate deployment and predict potential impact of new malaria interventions by considering operational, health-system, population, and disease characteristics. Our method relies on consultation with product development stakeholders to define the putative space of novel intervention specifications. We couple the disease model with machine learning to search this multi-dimensional space and efficiently identify optimal intervention properties that achieve specified health goals. We demonstrate the power of our approach by application to five malaria interventions in development.

Results Aiming for malaria prevalence reduction, we identify and quantify key determinants of intervention impact along with their minimal properties required to achieve the desired health goals. While coverage is generally identified as the largest driver of impact, higher efficacy, longer protection duration or multiple deployments per year are needed to increase prevalence reduction. We show that the efficacy and duration needs depend on the biological action of the interventions. Interventions on multiple parasite or vector targets, as well as combinations the new interventions with drug treatment, lead to significant burden reductions and lower efficacy or duration requirements.

Conclusions Our approach uses disease dynamic models and machine learning to support decision-making and resource investment, facilitating development of new malaria interventions. By evaluating the intervention capabilities in relation to the targeted health goal, our analysis allows prioritization of interventions and of their specifications from an early stage in development, and subsequent investments to be channeled cost-effectively towards impact maximization. Although we focus on five malaria interventions, the analysis is generalizable to other new malaria interventions.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background Substantial research is underway to develop next-generation interventions that address current malaria control challenges. As there is limited testing in their early development, it is difficult to predefine intervention properties such as efficacy that achieve target health goals, and therefore challenging to prioritize selection of novel candidate interventions. Here, we present a quantitative approach to guide intervention development using mathematical models of malaria dynamics coupled with machine learning. Our analysis identifies requirements of efficacy, coverage, and duration of effect for five novel malaria interventions to achieve targeted reductions in malaria prevalence. This study highlights the role of mathematical models to support intervention development.

Methods A mathematical model of malaria transmission dynamics is used to simulate deployment and predict potential impact of new malaria interventions by considering operational, health-system, population, and disease characteristics. Our method relies on consultation with product development stakeholders to define the putative space of novel intervention specifications. We couple the disease model with machine learning to search this multi-dimensional space and efficiently identify optimal intervention properties that achieve specified health goals. We demonstrate the power of our approach by application to five malaria interventions in development.

Results Aiming for malaria prevalence reduction, we identify and quantify key determinants of intervention impact along with their minimal properties required to achieve the desired health goals. While coverage is generally identified as the largest driver of impact, higher efficacy, longer protection duration or multiple deployments per year are needed to increase prevalence reduction. We show that the efficacy and duration needs depend on the biological action of the interventions. Interventions on multiple parasite or vector targets, as well as combinations the new interventions with drug treatment, lead to significant burden reductions and lower efficacy or duration requirements.

Conclusions Our approach uses disease dynamic models and machine learning to support decision-making and resource investment, facilitating development of new malaria interventions. By evaluating the intervention capabilities in relation to the targeted health goal, our analysis allows prioritization of interventions and of their specifications from an early stage in development, and subsequent investments to be channeled cost-effectively towards impact maximization. Although we focus on five malaria interventions, the analysis is generalizable to other new malaria interventions.

  <meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Background Substantial research is underway to develop next-generation interventions that address current malaria control challenges. As there is limited testing in their early development, it is difficult to predefine intervention properties such as efficacy that achieve target health goals, and therefore challenging to prioritize selection of novel candidate interventions. Here, we present a quantitative approach to guide intervention development using mathematical models of malaria dynamics coupled with machine learning. Our analysis identifies requirements of efficacy, coverage, and duration of effect for five novel malaria interventions to achieve targeted reductions in malaria prevalence. This study highlights the role of mathematical models to support intervention development.

Methods A mathematical model of malaria transmission dynamics is used to simulate deployment and predict potential impact of new malaria interventions by considering operational, health-system, population, and disease characteristics. Our method relies on consultation with product development stakeholders to define the putative space of novel intervention specifications. We couple the disease model with machine learning to search this multi-dimensional space and efficiently identify optimal intervention properties that achieve specified health goals. We demonstrate the power of our approach by application to five malaria interventions in development.

Results Aiming for malaria prevalence reduction, we identify and quantify key determinants of intervention impact along with their minimal properties required to achieve the desired health goals. While coverage is generally identified as the largest driver of impact, higher efficacy, longer protection duration or multiple deployments per year are needed to increase prevalence reduction. We show that the efficacy and duration needs depend on the biological action of the interventions. Interventions on multiple parasite or vector targets, as well as combinations the new interventions with drug treatment, lead to significant burden reductions and lower efficacy or duration requirements.

Conclusions Our approach uses disease dynamic models and machine learning to support decision-making and resource investment, facilitating development of new malaria interventions. By evaluating the intervention capabilities in relation to the targeted health goal, our analysis allows prioritization of interventions and of their specifications from an early stage in development, and subsequent investments to be channeled cost-effectively towards impact maximization. Although we focus on five malaria interventions, the analysis is generalizable to other new malaria interventions.

                               Background
                              </strong>
                              Substantial research is underway to develop next-generation interventions that address current malaria control challenges. As there is limited testing in their early development, it is difficult to predefine intervention properties such as efficacy that achieve target health goals, and therefore challenging to prioritize selection of novel candidate interventions. Here, we present a quantitative approach to guide intervention development using mathematical models of malaria dynamics coupled with machine learning. Our analysis identifies requirements of efficacy, coverage, and duration of effect for five novel malaria interventions to achieve targeted reductions in malaria prevalence. This study highlights the role of mathematical models to support intervention development.

                              A mathematical model of malaria transmission dynamics is used to simulate deployment and predict potential impact of new malaria interventions by considering operational, health-system, population, and disease characteristics. Our method relies on consultation with product development stakeholders to define the putative space of novel intervention specifications. We couple the disease model with machine learning to search this multi-dimensional space and efficiently identify optimal intervention properties that achieve specified health goals. We demonstrate the power of our approach by application to five malaria interventions in development.

                              Aiming for malaria prevalence reduction, we identify and quantify key determinants of intervention impact along with their minimal properties required to achieve the desired health goals. While coverage is generally identified as the largest driver of impact, higher efficacy, longer protection duration or multiple deployments per year are needed to increase prevalence reduction. We show that the efficacy and duration needs depend on the biological action of the interventions. Interventions on multiple parasite or vector targets, as well as combinations the new interventions with drug treatment, lead to significant burden reductions and lower efficacy or duration requirements.

                              Our approach uses disease dynamic models and machine learning to support decision-making and resource investment, facilitating development of new malaria interventions. By evaluating the intervention capabilities in relation to the targeted health goal, our analysis allows prioritization of interventions and of their specifications from an early stage in development, and subsequent investments to be channeled cost-effectively towards impact maximization. Although we focus on five malaria interventions, the analysis is generalizable to other new malaria interventions.

                             Significant efforts to deploy malaria interventions worldwide have led to considerable progress and have reduced global malaria prevalence in Africa by half over the 2000 to 2015 period (

                             ). Reductions were achieved through a diverse range of interventions including mass distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor residual spraying, rapid diagnosis, as well as artemisinin-based combination therapies. However, since 2015 progress has stalled, and several countries have seen an increase in malaria incidence of over 40% (

                             ). Current interventions and malaria control programs are facing major challenges due to lack of funding, increases in drug and insecticide resistance and diagnostic-resistant parasites, as well as supply chain and deployment difficulties (

                             Consequently, the malaria product development space has steadily expanded over the last 15 years. Novel products are diverse, ranging from therapeutic and immunological interventions, such as drugs and vaccines, to new vector control tools. Here we provide an overview of these novel interventions and explore the properties for a subset of key interventions.

                             Malaria products under development are defined through Target Product Profiles (TPPs), which constitutes a vital reference for dialogue between various stakeholders (listed in the Methods section) to guide R&D investments. TPPs are dynamic documents used during the development of a cutting-edge medical product, defining its required characteristics to fulfill an unmet health need (

Given the large amount of malaria interventions currently in the development pipeline, a systematic approach is essential to inform development decisions and prioritization of novel interventions to ensure a sustainable investment of resources and a fast pace of innovation. Currently, there is no approach systematically incorporating quantitative evidence and the aforementioned operational aspects in malaria product development (including intervention deployment, efficacy, duration, decay, and public health impact) from early development stages.

                             Due to absence of data at early intervention development stages and computational limitations in exploring a highly combinatorial parameter space of presumed intervention characteristics, models have mainly been used at late stages of intervention development. To date, models have only been minimally applied in directing the design of new interventions, or in understanding how intervention-specific, epidemiological, and systems factors jointly contribute to impact. Model investigations are usually informed by scenario analysis accounting for delivery and target age groups, as well as with properties of the new intervention pre-defined or informed by late clinical trials (

                             ). In these constrained scenarios, high model and parameter complexity tend to obscure the complex relationships between intervention parameters, operational factors, health outcomes, and public health impact (

                             ). Exhaustive scenario analyses are computationally expensive, rendering the full exploration of all possible interventions, in conjunction with all possible delivery scenarios, combinatorically infeasible. Previous approaches using disease models to inform TPPs have tackled the combinatorically complex parameter space by only exploring a discrete, constrained set of parameters (

                             ), where epidemiological models guide development of novel disease interventions designed to achieve quantified health goals from the early stages, placing the end goal of public health impact at the center of decision-making. To do this efficiently, we undertook an iteratively engaged exchange with malaria product development stakeholders to define desired outcomes and likely delivery use-cases of new malaria interventions. We then used mathematical models combined with machine learning to perform a directed search of the entire space of intervention profiles, to define properties of new interventions towards achieving the desired health goals. We used Gaussian processes (GPs) (

                             ) to generate computationally light emulators that work in combination with the established OpenMalaria model of malaria dynamics. These emulators accurately captured the non-linear relationships between properties of deployed interventions, operational factors, and resulting health outcomes. They allowed efficient sensitivity analyses of intervention and health system parameters on predicted public health impacts at low computational cost. Furthermore, by coupling emulators with nonlinear optimization techniques, we constructed a predictive framework that identified key determinants of intervention impact as well as the minimal intervention profiles required for achieving a given health goal (

We used our approach to understand the link between intervention characteristics and resulting impact, and to define the requirements of these interventions in terms of coverage, efficacy, and impact duration to reach desired prevalence reduction goals, contingent on operational constraints (

Accordingly, we collaborated with the BMGF, and the PATH-MVI and IVCC product development partnerships. For each new intervention in the portfolios for PATH-MVI, IVCC, and others, we conducted several expert group discussion sessions to catalogue the ranges of potential intervention effectiveness; potential delivery strategies; parasite or vector targets; and likely properties (age target, mass intervention, yearly deployment) in terms of mode of action (target), efficacy, and duration; and use-cases/delivery (see Methods and Additional file 1:

                             Due to the significantly less intensive computational requirements of our emulator-based approach compared with OpenMalaria, we could reduce the analysis execution time by several orders of magnitude. This allowed us to conduct global sensitivity and optimization analyses, which required a large number of parameter set evaluations and would otherwise not have been possible (

In addition, we performed a constrained search for intervention and delivery profiles (TPPs) that maximized impact under a particular health goal, given concrete, expert-informed, operational constraints such as possible deployment coverage, or feasible intervention properties such as efficacy or duration of protection (

We found that, in general, when aiming for substantial, prompt reductions in prevalence for this particular health target, vector control was by far the most impactful intervention across all settings. Conversely, monoclonal antibodies, anti-infective and transmission-blocking vaccines had a more pronounced impact in low-transmission settings compared to endemic settings (

                              Sensitivity analysis indicated that the impact of these interventions on malaria prevalence was driven by different characteristics of their efficacy profiles, deployment strategies, or access to care for treatment of clinical cases, for short- and long-impact follow-up. Across a large proportion of the simulated scenarios, for all parasite and vector targets and interventions, deployed intervention coverage was overwhelmingly the primary driver of impact, especially in low-transmission settings (

This has important implications for interventions requiring multiple applications to achieve high efficacy, indicating that it is of crucial importance to target both vulnerable populations and the proportion of the population missed by the intervention. While, for some interventions, high coverage deployment might be difficult or impossible to achieve, our analysis showed that this can be alleviated by increasing the deployment frequency or through deploying combinations of interventions, which may also have cost implications (

                              We found that combining several interventions targeting different stages in the transmission cycle can strongly affect the minimum requirements of a putative new intervention, potentially increasing the impact of an otherwise weaker intervention. For example, for an anti-infective monoclonal antibody with an initial half-life of 4 months that is deployed at a coverage of 60% reflecting completion of multiple doses, achieving 80% prevalence reduction was impossible when deployed once yearly for three years (

Combining vaccine deployment with a blood-stage drug not only significantly expanded the achievable health targets in high-transmission settings, but also reduced vaccine properties requirements. Our analysis revealed that anti-infective vaccines had a higher potential than transmission-blocking vaccines, requiring less performance and achieving higher prevalence reductions targets in higher transmission settings. When combined with blood-stage parasite treatment, the coverage, efficacy, and half-life requirements of anti-infective vaccines were lower compared with those of transmission-blocking vaccines for the same prevalence reduction targets (

                              We also showed that a modified deployment schedule could reduce requirements for properties of some interventions. For example, for highly efficacious attractive targeted sugar baits, higher coverage and half-life were required when implemented once per year for three years compared with accelerated delivery of twice per year for three years (

This suggests that, once a vector control intervention, such as attractive targeted sugar baits, has achieved a high killing efficacy (here ≥70%), a next step of optimizing other intervention characteristics, such as deployment coverage or duration, would lead to higher impact. These results demonstrate the strength of our analysis in identifying intervention characteristics to be prioritized for R&D.

                             In this study, we introduced a quantitative framework, using detailed simulation models of malaria transmission dynamics that enables for the first time a quantitative differentiation between operational, transmission setting, and intervention parameters to better understand the potential impact of novel interventions against malaria. The framework consists of (i) a comprehensive disease progression and transmission simulation model applied on a discrete, uniformly sampled set of input parameters; (ii) training of a GP emulator on the sampled set of parameters and corresponding impact outcomes; (iii) using sensitivity analysis to understand drivers of intervention impact; and (iv) applying a non-linear constrained optimization algorithm to explore intervention operational and effectiveness characteristics meeting various targets and deployment use-cases specified following iterative consultation with product development experts. Our work thus builds on recent applications of GPs in disease modelling and burden prediction for malaria (

                             The value of our approach is realized through iterative collaboration with product development experts, by providing model-based guidance throughout the development process, and by refining feedback on model predictions as interventions progress through development. For malaria, where multiple interventions are in development, it also offers an approach for product developers from diverse fields (such as therapeutics and insecticide development) to collaborate and incorporate knowledge of other interventions into their TPP development. Coordinated by BMGF, the exchanges with stakeholders ensured a crucial discussion environment, guiding and supporting the methodology at various levels, from intervention profiling and defining relevant intervention use-cases to shaping research questions and subsequent analyses. This framework has been presented and validated in the presence of stakeholders in successive meetings. Discussions contributed to refinement of the investigation of various intervention profiles and led to an exploration of intervention combinations. Consequently, iterative exchanges with stakeholders have not only shaped the study approach, but had proven the value of this methodological framework in its versatility to adapt and address key questions along the product development pathway.

                             Using a detailed individual-based malaria transmission model like OpenMalaria brings significant advantages compared to a simpler and computationally less intensive Ross-MacDonald model. Individual-based models capture interactions between hosts, vectors, and parasites at the individual level, which provides a more realistic representation of the nonlinear transmission and epidemiological processes in the population as well as of the stochasticity of the modelled system (
                             <a id="xref-ref-58-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-58">

                             ). Second, it allows a realistic implementation of interventions, allowing for explicitly modeling intervention characteristics relevant for defining TPPs such as deployment regimes, efficacy, half-life, or shape of decay as well as explicit action at the different stages of the transmission cycle. Conversely, with Ross-MacDonald models, the modelled interventions have a very simplified representation through their effect only on transmission rates and this representation does not scale to the required detailed specifications of interventions in TPP documents.

The same rationale applies for investigating other deployment strategies, required doses of interventions, or additional intervention combinations. However, this approach, which uses a smooth GP model, is not tailored for classification and categorical health goals. Nevertheless, it could be adapted to these types of outputs by replacing the GP emulator with a predictive model/alternative algorithm suited for categorical data, such as support vector machines. While sensitivity analysis would still be applicable for identifying the drivers of the categorical outcomes, the optimization questions and analyses would need to be reformulated to be relevant for the chosen categorical outcomes.

                             This approach constitutes a powerful tool to help address the challenges of current malaria strategies and develop new interventions to progress towards malaria elimination. While currently promising interventions such as insecticide treated nets, seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), and intermittent preventative treatment (IPT) have been very successful at reducing malaria incidence and saving lives, their improved burden reduction and future success is being challenged by limited adherence, limited resources, and time constraints towards increasing coverage and usage in underserved populations, as well as resistance (

                             ). Furthermore, for settings where SMC is not recommended or has not been implemented (for example in East Africa or in perennial settings), there remains a gap in available interventions to protect vulnerable populations who experience the highest burden of malaria. Similarly, for settings with outdoor biting mosquitoes, development and rollout of novel vector control interventions is needed. New therapeutics and immune therapies suitable for seasonal delivery, such as long-acting injectables or monoclonal antibodies, are being developed and may close the development gap (

                             This quantitative framework can support the development of interventions from the beginning by generating evidence to inform and define evaluation criteria ensuring new products meet relevant health targets, while considering how these products may affect disease burden and epidemiology within a population. As shown here, this relies on iterative dialogue with stakeholders, to first define health targets, simulated scenarios, achievable intervention properties, and operational settings. The modelling part of the framework incorporates all this information as well as relevant disease transmission dynamics, building an in-silico system for testing developed interventions. Next, the sensitivity analysis part of the framework informs which intervention characteristics drive impact and are thus crucial in achieving the defined health goal. Providing insights on the development processes to be prioritized. Finally, the optimization analysis part of the framework reveals the potential of the developed intervention and how its efficacy and coverage requirements change according to the defined health targets and deployment setting. The landscapes of intervention profiles help product developers gauge development and investment efforts and select promising products. Furthermore, our approach allows investigating combinations of new and existing interventions, identifying alternatives to alleviate shortcomings such as coverage limitations. To achieve a final TPP, several iterations of this analysis are required, to ensure that the optimal tradeoffs between intervention capabilities and target goals for a given setting are best achieved.

                             As with all modelling studies, this approach is subject to several limitations. While the emulators capture not just the mean tendency of complex disease models dynamics, but also the inherent output variance caused by the stochasticity in the models (

Despite the intrinsic uncertainty, this framework is intended to provide guiding principles and an efficient means of exploring the high dimensional space of intervention characteristics that otherwise would not be possible. Evidently, this analysis relies on the representativeness of model assumptions of disease and transmission dynamics as well as of expert opinion of likely intervention parameterizations in absence of clinical knowledge. Lastly, this analysis only explored a subset of use-cases, transmission settings, and intervention combinations. Future work should focus on the most likely settings and relevant use-cases as interventions are being developed and corresponding TPP documents are being refined.

                             Moving beyond the work presented in this paper, this framework would allow combining simulation models with other sources of data describing geographical variation in disease, for example, modelled health systems or modelled prevalence (

                             </a>
                             ) and would allow incorporating interactions of interventions with novel interventions for surveillance. Clinical trials for new interventions could thereby be prioritized to geographical settings, where public health impact is likely to be maximized, and where appropriate, to inform decisions on achieving non-inferiority or superiority endpoints (
                             <a id="xref-ref-64-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-64">

                             </a>
                             ). A significant extension would be to incorporate economic considerations that may affect development decisions, including both R&D costs, as well as implementation and systems costs for final deployment.

                             In this work, we provide mathematical tools for efficiently and quantitatively defining the minimum profiles of malaria interventions, as well as delivery approaches required to reach a desired health goal. Our framework can be extended and used for any disease where a valid model of disease progression or natural history of disease is available. It can be used to direct the design of novel interventions and to better understand how intervention-specific, epidemiological and systems factors jointly contribute to impact. Most immediately, this approach is highly relevant to define successful interventions against new diseases, and to support efficient, fast development of operational strategies. As uncertainties in disease progression and epidemiology can be incorporated in our approach by accordingly adjusting the putative parameter space of intervention characteristics, it also provides a way to systematically sort through large complex landscapes of unknowns and refine properties of interventions following clinical trials as more knowledge becomes available.

                             Our framework tackles and moves beyond current challenges in product development. On one hand, it allows rigorous definition of TPPs by efficiently exploring highly complex parameter spaces of disease models, and on the other hand, it allows determinants of desired public health impact to be identified to inform tradeoffs between product characteristics and use-cases.

                               There was active engagement and regular communication exchanges with different expert groups during development of this methodological framework for guiding Target Product Profiles (TPPs) of novel malaria interventions. The aims of these exchanges were (

                               ). A well-constructed TPP is thus essential for efficient resource allocation and success during development (

                               ). However, the process of establishing TPPs relies on minimal clinical or quantitative evidence. They are often set by expert opinion and consensus is based on limited quantitative consideration of the complex dynamics of disease or on predictions of the likely intervention impact while achieving the identified unmet health needs (
                               <a id="xref-ref-133-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-133">

                               ). Furthermore, few malaria TPPs consider operational aspects such as deployment coverage in addition to product-specific characteristics such as efficacy or half-life. This has implications for the appropriate definition of intervention effectiveness characteristics according to local health systems and health targets (

                               The stakeholders involved in these discussions were the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), the Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC), and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health - Malaria Vaccine Initiative (PATH-MVI) and the WHO (

                               ). Exchanges with these stakeholders were coordinated and guided by BMGF through regular meetings as follows. First, there was an initial convening with all stakeholders to frame the key study questions, to establish a network for iterative dialogue and to inform the partners about OpenMalaria, its components, features, and validity of assumptions. At these meetings, there were over 15 participants from BMGF, IVCC, PATH-MVI, and Swiss TPH. The health goal of malaria prevalence reduction in all ages was chosen during this meeting, as well as the five malaria interventions on which to focus our analysis. Second, several one-to-one iterative meetings were held with each stakeholder to define the way the five chosen interventions are implemented in OpenMalaria and to define relevant aspects to consider for their deployment (e.g., targets in the malaria transmission cycle, shape of decay, mass deployment, assessing impact at early and late follow-up), as well as putative ranges of their characteristics. We consulted with BMGF and PATH-MVI to refine the modeled vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and drugs, and with IVCC to refine attractive targeted sugar baits and eave tubes. The set of simulated transmission settings (seasonality, indoor biting) were also defined during these meetings. Interim meetings were held with several stakeholders where we presented proof-of-concept and intermediate analyses. These meetings ensured building trust and a high level of confidence from our stakeholders in this analysis, while shaping the research questions. For example, an intermediate result was that the determinants of impact of novel interventions were different in low as compared with moderate transmission settings. This motivated exploring a wide range of PfPR settings to ascertain how impact determinants were modulated as transmission increased. Another early result was that the efficacy, coverage, and half-life requirements of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines were significantly high, and that it was infeasible to reach high targets of prevalence reduction in high-transmission settings deploying these interventions alone. The subsequent discussions led to the exploration of deploying combinations of these interventions with an antimalarial drug and to refining target health goals based on the capabilities of the interventions to reduce burden. Results were presented during several stakeholder meetings and included in reports along with outlining prospects for future work.

                               Regular presentations of this ongoing analysis were provided to BMGF. These presentations covered relevant model assumptions for implementing different interventions, focusing on aspects where stakeholder feedback was needed, as well as intermediary results where model predictions for the interventions were shown. This ensured a dynamic iterative exchange where stakeholders were directly involved in shaping intervention characteristics, allowing them to see how their input was incorporated in this methodology (

                               ) and how these assumptions influenced the impact predictions of this analysis. These exchanges helped us design and refine the means of communication for this methodological approach and model predictions to a wider stakeholder audience. For this purpose, communication elements were used, such as tables summarizing the key quantitative results (e.g.,

OpenMalaria specifically captures heterogeneity in host exposure, susceptibility, and immune response, taking into consideration the effects of several factors such as acquired immunity, human demography structure, and seasonality (

Each simulated infected human host has an associated parasite density and duration of infection (modelled individually and capturing disease effects such as immunity, infectiousness to mosquitoes, morbidity, or mortality). Setting-specific characteristics such as population demographics, mosquito species entomological characteristics or seasonality are explicitly modelled and a wide range of human and vector interventions can be applied, affecting the transmission cycle at various stages. Various health outcomes are monitored over time, including Plasmodium falciparum prevalence of infections (PfPR), uncomplicated clinical disease, severe disease in and out of hospital, and malaria mortality. Disease dynamics model assumptions have been described and validated with field data in previous studies, notably in (

The ratios between the population sizes of indoor and outdoor mosquito species were classified into three levels corresponding to high (indoor proportion of 0.8 of total mosquito population), mid (indoor proportion of 0.5) and low biting (indoor proportion of 0.2). The extent of malaria transmission in each simulation was defined by the annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR). For each simulation, EIR was sampled from the interval [1-25] leading to a simulated range of Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate or prevalence (PfPR) distributions across the various transmission settings (Additional file 1:

Each EIR level on the x-axis is defined as a set of continuous input EIR values which range between the current level and the current level-1, e.g., an input EIR level of 1 contains EIR values in the interval (0, 1].

                               As stated in the Methods, since it was computationally intensive and challenging to run an exhaustive number of simulations in order to explore the entire parameter space for diverse combinations of interventions, settings, and deployments using OpenMalaria, machine learning techniques and kernel methods were applied. Precisely, starting from a training dataset of simulations generated with OpenMalaria, Gaussian process (GP) models (

Precisely, the training set was split into 5 subsets and, iteratively, 4 of these subsets were used for training the GP, while the remaining set was used as an out-of-sample test set during the cross-validation procedure. After assessing the prediction error obtained during the cross-validation procedure, the GP was trained using the entire training set.

                               Furthermore, since the trained GP model provides the mean and variance for each predicted output, this probabilistic representation was used to assess the uncertainty of the trained model across the entire parameter space and to refine the GP model through adaptive sampling (

Accordingly, new training points from high-uncertainty regions of the parameter space were iteratively sampled and the model was updated with the new training samples. Precisely, 100,000 points were sampled using Latin hypercube sampling and the variance of the predicted output was evaluated with the previously trained GP emulator. Samples from “rare” regions of the parameter space containing fewer outputs were prioritized. To do so, the output PfPR

Of the sampled points, 30 points (300 including replicates) were chosen proportional to the output density in each bin and with the highest predicted variance. This procedure was repeated five times to ensure that the correlation between true and predicted values on an out-of-sample test set had reached a plateau. Finally, a separate out-of-sample test set was built to assess the overall performance of the GP (Additional file 1:

To ensure optimality of the obtained solutions and to avoid local minima, 10 random restarts were chosen among 1,000 uniformly sampled input parameter sets and the optimization procedure was run separately for each restart (implemented in function gosolnp in the same R package). To capture the variance of the optimal intervention profile, since the output of a GP model is a distribution, the above optimization problem was solved for several cases, and the distribution of the obtained minima are reported when:
