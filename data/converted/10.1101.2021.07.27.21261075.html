  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background There are many small datasets of significant value in the medical space that are being underutilized. Due to the heterogeneity of complex disorders found in oncology, systems capable of discovering patient subpopulations while elucidating etiologies is of great value as it can indicate leads for innovative drug discovery and development.

Materials and Methods Here, we report on a machine intelligence-based study that utilized a combination of two small non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) datasets consisting of 58 samples of adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 45 samples (GSE18842). Utilizing a set of standard machine learning (ML) methods which are described in this paper, we were able to uncover subpopulations of ADC and SCC while simultaneously extracting which genes, in combination, were significantly involved in defining the subpopulations. We also utilized a proprietary interactive hypothesis-generating method designed to work with machine learning methods, which provided us with an alternative way of pinpointing the most important combination of variables. The discovered gene expression variables were used to train ML models. This allowed us to create methods using standard methods and to also validate our in-house methods for heterogeneous patient populations, as is often found in oncology.

Results Using these methods, we were able to uncover genes implicated by other methods and accurately discover known subpopulations without being asked, such as different levels of aggressiveness within the SCC and ADC subtypes. Furthermore, PIGX was a novel gene implicated in this study that warrants further study due to its role in breast cancer proliferation.

Conclusion Here we demonstrate the ability to learn from small datasets and reveal well-established properties of NSCLC. This demonstrates the utility for machine learning techniques to reveal potential genes of interest, even from small data sets, and thus the driving factors behind subpopulations of patients.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Background There are many small datasets of significant value in the medical space that are being underutilized. Due to the heterogeneity of complex disorders found in oncology, systems capable of discovering patient subpopulations while elucidating etiologies is of great value as it can indicate leads for innovative drug discovery and development.

Materials and Methods Here, we report on a machine intelligence-based study that utilized a combination of two small non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) datasets consisting of 58 samples of adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 45 samples (GSE18842). Utilizing a set of standard machine learning (ML) methods which are described in this paper, we were able to uncover subpopulations of ADC and SCC while simultaneously extracting which genes, in combination, were significantly involved in defining the subpopulations. We also utilized a proprietary interactive hypothesis-generating method designed to work with machine learning methods, which provided us with an alternative way of pinpointing the most important combination of variables. The discovered gene expression variables were used to train ML models. This allowed us to create methods using standard methods and to also validate our in-house methods for heterogeneous patient populations, as is often found in oncology.

Results Using these methods, we were able to uncover genes implicated by other methods and accurately discover known subpopulations without being asked, such as different levels of aggressiveness within the SCC and ADC subtypes. Furthermore, PIGX was a novel gene implicated in this study that warrants further study due to its role in breast cancer proliferation.

Conclusion Here we demonstrate the ability to learn from small datasets and reveal well-established properties of NSCLC. This demonstrates the utility for machine learning techniques to reveal potential genes of interest, even from small data sets, and thus the driving factors behind subpopulations of patients.

                              Here, we report on a machine intelligence-based study that utilized a combination of two small non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) datasets consisting of 58 samples of adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 45 samples (GSE18842). Utilizing a set of standard machine learning (ML) methods which are described in this paper, we were able to uncover subpopulations of ADC and SCC while simultaneously extracting which genes, in combination, were significantly involved in defining the subpopulations. We also utilized a proprietary interactive hypothesis-generating method designed to work with machine learning methods, which provided us with an alternative way of pinpointing the most important combination of variables. The discovered gene expression variables were used to train ML models. This allowed us to create methods using standard methods and to also validate our in-house methods for heterogeneous patient populations, as is often found in oncology.

                              Using these methods, we were able to uncover genes implicated by other methods and accurately discover known subpopulations without being asked, such as different levels of aggressiveness within the SCC and ADC subtypes. Furthermore, PIGX was a novel gene implicated in this study that warrants further study due to its role in breast cancer proliferation.

                              Here we demonstrate the ability to learn from small datasets and reveal well-established properties of NSCLC. This demonstrates the utility for machine learning techniques to reveal potential genes of interest, even from small data sets, and thus the driving factors behind subpopulations of patients.

                             The collection of transcriptomic data is expensive, resulting in datasets with a small number of sample sizes (in the hundreds) but thousands of variables. As a result, several techniques that are making significant strides in the imaging space, such as deep neural networks, are not suitable for these datasets, as a large number of samples are required. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the patient population and the complexity of diseases found in oncology requires going beyond the labels. The development of techniques that can explain the driving variables behind patient subpopulations is tremendously valuable in identifying and developing novel therapeutic agents – this is particularly relevant for mapping out heterogeneous diseases such as lung cancer.

ML with statistical modelling tailored for small datasets has shown promise in showcasing disease heterogeneity[

Because large datasets are critical for contemporary machine learning methods such as CNNs, there is a need for alternative techniques when data banks are insufficient to train the model. In addition, significant features found within small datasets may become diluted by more obvious statistical features and hence over-represented in large datasets. As such, ML methods must be carefully used and complemented by statistical methods that allow for the discovery of non-linear ways in which groups of genes may interact to drive disease heterogeneity. The methodology presented here is designed for small datasets, which presents as a novel way of hypothesizing genetic subpopulations that may result in pathanogenesis. Our findings support genes previously reported to distinguish ADC and SCC subtypes. However, the novelty of this work lies in the machine’s ability to discover previously unknown subpopulations that are defined by several genes at a time. These findings shed light on the different mechanisms at play within these subtypes.

Some proprietary algorithms were used to organize the resulting clustering models, in addition to the random forest models, such that we were able to explore the models interactively to derive a deeper understanding of the driving genes behind the sub-clusters [

By allowing ourselves to use the proprietary organization methods provided by the NetraAI, we were able to identify subpopulations that we could compare with statistical methods suitable for a dataset with so few samples and avoid overfitting that often comes with utilizing machine learning methods with small datasets.

Previous studies have reported on differentially expressed genes in ADC and SCC. Here, we identified 17 genes that discriminate between SCC and ADC (

Interestingly, we found genes associated with gap junctions and tight junctions to be strong driving forces differentiating SCC and ADC. It is noteworthy that PIGX was the only gene identified that has not been previously associated with NSCLC. Although there have been reports that PIGX promotes cancer cell proliferation by suppressing EHD2 and ZIC1, this warrants further investigation [

Interestingly, the elevated expression of DSC3 was associated with males; however, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.062 for 206032_at and p = 0.077 for 206033_s_at). In contrast, the two probes corresponding to CGN, 223232_s_at and 223233_s_at were significantly associated with ADC (p < 0.0001) (

                             This study highlights the genetic heterogeneity within NSCLC subtypes. Using a small dataset, we were able to identify a set of 17 genes that distinguish SCC and ADC (

                             ). Within these 17 genes, most have been previously reported to be associated either with NSCLC or a specific subtype of NSCLC, validating our ML approach. These findings were aligned with previous reports on SCC genes being associated with the organization and assembly of cell and gap junctions, glutathione conjugation and the redox stress response, ECM organization and collagen-related proteins, interferon and cytokine signaling, and HLA downregulation and ADC genes associated with ECM organization proteins and complement, interferon and cytokine signaling, and collagen-related genes and proteins for ECM organization [

                             ]. Another study identified epidermis development, cell division, and epithelial cell differentiation as the most common categories characterizing SCC, and cell adhesion enrichment, biological adhesion, and coagulation for ADC [

                             ]. However, some of the genes we identified have not been previously associated with NSCLC or a specific subtype and represent areas that warrant greater investigation for the advancement of precision medicine in NSCLC. Below, the genes of interest found using our methodology are highlighted in the context of previous findings in NSCLC.

                             The approach utilized here to derive the insights relied on the ability for certain machine learning methods to create hypotheses about subpopulations of patients, and then to statistically test the driving variables of these subgroups of patients. In this way, we utilize machine learning to derive potential insights and then utilize statistical methods that are suitable for small data to evaluate differential expression. In order to create robust predictive models with machine intelligence, one requires large data sets, but here we utilized the ability for some of these methods to create hypotheses instead, and then use methods appropriate for small data to test these hypotheses. This bidirectional attack allowed us to derive insights from these small datasets that have been previously validated and to finally derive a new potential role for the gene PIGX in NSCLC.

                              This study highlights a methodology that targets genes of interest in a small, heterogenous subpopulation of NSCLC. Although small populations are more prone to local drivers of genetic heterogeneity, they will not encompass all genes that may drive other subtypes of NSCLC in patients. Therefore, a limitation of this methodology resides in it’s inability to forecast more obvious patterns found in larger datasets.
