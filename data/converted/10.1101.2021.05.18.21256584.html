  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Despite recent development of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients remains an important goal. In principle, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) could shortcut the clinical evidence needed to repurpose drugs - the use of an existing drug for a new indication. However, it has been shown that the genes found in GWA studies usually do not encode an established drug target and the causal role for disease, a key requirement for drug efficacy, is unclear. We report here an alternative method for finding and testing causal target candidates for drug repurposing.

Methods Rather than focusing on the genetics of the disease, we looked for disease-causing traits by searching for significant differences in 33 blood cell types, 30 blood biochemistries, and body mass index between an infectious disease phenotype and healthy controls. We then matched critically ill COVID-19 cases with controls that exhibited mild or no symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to identify disease-causing traits by applying causal inference methods.

Results We found high neutrophil cell count as a causal trait for the immune overreaction in critical illness due to COVID-19. Based on these findings, we identified the enzyme CDK6 as a potential drug target to prevent the immune overreaction in critical illness due to COVID-19.

Conclusions The genetics of disease-causing traits turns out to be a rich reservoir for the identification of known drug targets. This is due to the usually larger datasets of traits, as they also cover healthy ones. A clinical trial testing CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib in critically ill COVID-19 patients is currently ongoing ([ClinicalTrials.gov][1] Identifier: [NCT05371275][2]).

                               Background
                              </strong>
                              Despite recent development of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients remains an important goal. In principle, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) could shortcut the clinical evidence needed to repurpose drugs - the use of an existing drug for a new indication. However, it has been shown that the genes found in GWA studies usually do not encode an established drug target and the causal role for disease, a key requirement for drug efficacy, is unclear. We report here an alternative method for finding and testing causal target candidates for drug repurposing.

                              Rather than focusing on the genetics of the disease, we looked for disease-causing traits by searching for significant differences in 33 blood cell types, 30 blood biochemistries, and body mass index between an infectious disease phenotype and healthy controls. We then matched critically ill COVID-19 cases with controls that exhibited mild or no symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to identify disease-causing traits by applying causal inference methods.

                              We found high neutrophil cell count as a causal trait for the immune overreaction in critical illness due to COVID-19. Based on these findings, we identified the enzyme CDK6 as a potential drug target to prevent the immune overreaction in critical illness due to COVID-19.

                             Overall, 15 independent genome-wide significant loci associations were reported for COVID-19 infection in general, of which six were found to be associated with critical illness due to COVID-19: 3p21.31 close to CXCR6, which plays a role in chemokine signaling, and LZTFL1, which has been implicated in lung cancer; 12q24.13 in a gene cluster that encodes antiviral restriction enzyme activators; 17q21.31, containing the KANSL1 gene, which has been previously reported for reduced lung function; 19p13.3 within the gene that encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9); 19p13.2 encoding tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2); and 21q22.11 encoding the interferon receptor gene IFNAR2. The functions of the genes associated with these six loci are either related to host antiviral defense mechanisms or are mediators of inflammatory organ damage.

                             Nonetheless, using GWA data for drug development has several general drawbacks, which are particularly evident here with COVID-19. First, none of the reported genes encodes an established drug target. Rather, the exact function of the gene variants found in patients with critical illness due to COVID-19 is unclear. Therefore, it is questionable whether the gene product can be manipulated in function by a drug at all. Second, GWA studies only correlate genes with the disease. A causal relationship, which is important for drug development, cannot be deduced from this. Third, due to the currently limited sample size of GWA study datasets (<5,000 individuals), biologically relevant rare variants with small effect sizes cannot be detected.

                             , critically ill COVID-19 patients were matched with a control group of COVID-19 patients with mild illness. Traits that differed significantly in cases and controls were further examined for causality with respect to critical illness in COVID-19 (

Focusing on the genetics of disease-causing traits reveals three advantages: First, disease-causing traits can more likely be manipulated with a drug via largely known druggable targets such as enzymes or receptors. Second, unlike a disease-associated gene, the function and, from there, causality of a gene for a trait is easier to verify. Third, the sample size of trait datasets is far greater than that of datasets specifically for COVID-19. For example, datasets on traits such as blood biochemistry often include >500,000 cases. Therefore, biologically relevant rare variants with small effect sizes can be detected.

                               Workflow to identify traits leading to critical illness due to COVID-19. We identified significant differences in 64 candidate predictive traits between an infectious disease cohort and healthy controls. We used regression models to investigate the effect of these traits on critically ill COVID-19 cases compared to asymptomatic controls. Because highly dependent traits would not be significant in drop1 analysis, we first used collinearity testing to remove correlated traits. Using drop-one analysis, we identified neutrophil cell count as a trait that has a unique effect on critical illness in COVID-19.

We then estimated the effect of treatment on severe COVID-19 within each of the groups. The effect across these groups is examined and the average effect of treatment is calculated over the groups to give an estimate of effect of treatment independent of the covariates.

                              . First, we extracted variants on autosomal chromosomes. Then, we filtered samples for European ancestry, and we further dropped all samples with missing data for the phenotype of interest (neutrophil cell count) or for any of the following covariates: age, sex, BMI, and genetic principal components. These initial filtering steps left us with 444,114samples and 784,256 variants. Next, we filtered variants for minor allele frequency (MAF) using a threshold of 0.01 for the aggregate frequency and count of non-major alleles, since extremely rare alleles may indicate genotyping errors and furthermore are cases where power for detecting variant-to-phenotype associations is lacking. We then filtered variants based on missingness in the dataset with a threshold of 0.1, excluding variants where genotyping information is unavailable or of poor quality for more than 10 percent of subjects. Next, as an additional guard against genotyping errors, variants deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were removed where exact test p-values fell below the threshold of 1e-15. We then filtered samples with a missingness threshold of 0.1, excluding samples where genotyping information is unavailable or of poor quality for more than 10 percent of variants. This yielded a final dataset with a total of 444,109 samples and of 509,485 quality controlled variants. Finally, a genome-wide association analysis was performed in two steps with REGENIE

In the first step, a whole genome regression model was fitted using ridge regression, and in the second step, variants were tested for association with the continuous neutrophil cell count phenotype conditioned on the prediction of the model from the prior step using the “leave one chromosome out” scheme (LOCO) to avoid proximal contamination. In both steps, the first four genetic principal components were included as covariates.

Since no clear drug-to-gene assignment was possible for the gene variants of the HLA haplotype on chromosome 6, we focused on all other significant gene variants in the following. The most significant gene variants were found in the PSMD3 gene and are associated with bortezomib and carfilzomib according to the ChEMBL database. This is followed by gene variants in the CDK6 gene, that is associated with the drugs palbociclib, ribociclib, fulvestrant, abemaciclib, trilaciclib, apremilast and dexamethasone. Furthermore, gene variants and associated drugs were found in the genes NR1D1 (lithium), THRA (levothyroxine, liothyronine, aspirin, and lithium), CXCR2 (clotrimazole, acetylcysteine, and ibuprofen), as well as PLAUR (filgrastim and ruxolitinib). Bortezomib and carfilzomib are proteasome inhibitors approved for cancer therapy, whereas PSMD3 encodes one of the non-ATPase subunits of the 19S regulatory lid. Therefore, bortezomib and carfilzomib do not bind directly to the protein of the PSMD3 gene. In contrast, the drugs already approved for breast cancer abemaciclib, ribociclib, trilaciclib, and palbociclib bind directly to the protein encoded by the CDK6 gene, cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). Because of the high significance and direct binding of the drugs to CDK6, we considered this to be the best potential target for lowering neutrophil counts, and thus, preventing immune system overreaction in critical illness due to COVID-19 in high-risk individuals with high neutrophil counts.

                             In classical GWA studies, drug targets are rarely found. That is because GWA hits correlate with disease, but their causality, which is compelling for drug development, is not proven. Moreover, rare variants with small effect sizes are not found because of sample sizes that are drastically limited by the number of patients available for study. In contrast, here we describe a method that prioritizes the identification of traits with a causal role in disease pathogenesis. Subsequent investigation of the genetics of the disease-causing traits enables the discovery of drug targets that would not be found in classical GWA studies because of typically small sample sizes.

                             Our approach was as follows. First, we identified significant differences in 64 predictive characteristics between a cohort of infectious disease and healthy control subjects from the UK Biobank. Using regression models, we examined the effects of these characteristics on severely ill COVID-19 cases compared with mild control cases. Because highly correlated characteristics would be missed in a drop-one analysis, collinear (non-independent) characteristics were first removed. Of the remaining characteristics, neutrophil count was identified as a characteristic that had a unique impact on critical illness in COVID-19 independent of other characteristics. Age, male gender, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic liver and kidney disease have been previously described as risk factors for the severe course of COVID-19.

                             Ultimately, we focused on the genetics of neutrophils and came across the CDK6 gene. CDK6 encodes cyclin-dependent kinase 6, an enzyme involved in cell division, for which three drugs have already been developed and approved for the treatment of breast cancer. To better understand the role of CDK6 in neutrophil count, we defined the SNP rs445, which is known in the literature, as a genetic proxy for treatment with CDK6 inhibitors. To do this, we use regression models with rs445 as a variable to predict neutrophil cell count in the three different datasets: the full UK Biobank (471,532 cases), our case-control dataset comparing severe COVID-19 progression versus mild progression (3,010), and a randomly selected cohort from the UK Biobank with the same sample size of 3,010 cases. Only in the cohort from the entire UK Biobank did we detect an effect of rs445 on neutrophil count. The effect size of rs445 on neutrophil cell count is too small for rs445 to show significant effects in smaller data sets. That is supported by our statistical power analysis we conducted with the three datasets (

                             Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 have been previously described as regulators of NETosis. CDK4/6 inhibitors block NETs formation in a dose-responsive manner but do not impair oxidative burst, phagocytosis, or degranulation.

                             This indicates that CDK4/6 inhibition specifically affects NET production rather than universally modulating inflammatory pathways (in contrast to immunosuppressants such as dexamethasone or interleukin-6 inhibitors). This is supported by Grinshpun et al.’s report that COVID-19 progression was halted for a breast cancer patient on CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. Once the drug was withdrawn, the full classic spectrum of illness appeared, including oxygen desaturation necessitating a prolonged hospital stay for close monitoring of the need for invasive ventilations.

                             for this scenario. In our experiments, we saw the same result depending on how strictly clumping parameters were selected according to linkage disequilibrium (LD). If clumping was strict, we saw no effect. When we selected more variables due to a less stringent LD threshold, we found that a higher number of neutrophil cells seems to protect against the critical illness in COVID-19. However, the role of neutrophils as a driver of critical illness due to COVID-19 has been clearly described in the literature (see above). Why do we get this result in MR that is contrary to clinical observation? The reason can be explained by sample size in a manner analogous to the discussion of our regression analyses with rs445. As our statistical power analysis has shown, large sample sizes are needed to obtain a large number of gene variants with strong effect sizes. MR only works if a sufficient number of gene variants (instrument variables) with strong effect sizes for exposure and outcome are available. The summary statistics of neutrophil cell count and severe COVID-19 progression underlying MR show an imbalance of sample sizes. The here used statistics of the neutrophil cell count are based on 408,112 cases, whereas the statistics of critical illness in COVID-19 are based on only 5,582 cases. Ultimately, this leads to insufficient overlap of variables with the necessary effect size to generate a signal in Mendelian randomization. The artificial extension of the overlap by a less strict LD threshold seems to favor the amplification of false signals.

                             In conclusion, identifying drug targets from GWA data is challenging because of sample sizes limited by patient numbers and the accompanying high-dimensionality of the data structure. In addition, GWA studies only reflect associations and do not provide information on causality. In contrast, we have developed a workflow that enables the identification of causal drug targets via the identification and investigation of disease-causing traits. By focusing on the genetics of disease-causing traits, we can leverage larger sample sizes to reveal rare gene variants with small effect sizes. We applied our workflow to critical illness in COVID-19. We identified neutrophils as causal drivers of the disease. In addition, we found CDK6 as a drug target to reposition the already approved breast cancer drug palbociclib for potential preventive treatment of COVID-19. In the case reported by Grinshpun et al.,

                             ), but protected against thromboinflammation and thus prevented the necessity of intensive care. Another advantage rendering CDK6 an attractive drug target is that since it is a human protein, mutations of the virus do not influence drug action – in stark contrast to vaccines and antivirals. Ultimately, CDK4/6 inhibitors could be used against all virus-induced immune pathologies, and thus also contain future pandemics of novel viruses. A clinical trial testing a CDK6 inhibitor in critically ill COVID-19 patients is currently ongoing.
