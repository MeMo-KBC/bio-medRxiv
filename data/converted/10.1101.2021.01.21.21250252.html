  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Background For several cancers, including those of the breast, young age at diagnosis is associated with an adverse prognosis. Although this effect is often attributed to heritable mutations such as BRCA1/2, the relationship between pathologic features, young age of onset, and prognosis for breast cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we highlight links between age of onset and lymph node metastasis (NM) in US women with breast cancer.

Methods Case listings from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) 18 registry data for women with breast cancer, which include information on race, were used. NM and its associated outcomes were evaluated for a subset of women with receptor subtype information and then compared against a larger, pre-subtype validation set of data from the same registry. Age of diagnosis was a 5-category variable; under 40 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years and 70+ years. Univariate and adjusted multivariate survival models were applied to both sets of data.

Results As determined with adjusted logistic regression models, women under 40 years old at diagnosis had 1.55 times the odds of NM as women 60-69 years of age. The odds of NM for (HR = hormone receptor) HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+, and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes were significantly lower than those for HR+/HER2-. In subtype-stratified adjusted models, age of diagnosis had a consistent trend of decreasing odds of NM by age category, most noticeable for HR+ subtypes of luminal A and B. Univariate 5-year survival by age was worst for women under 40 years, with NM attributable for 49% of the hazard of death from cancer in adjusted multivariate models.

Conclusions Lymph node metastasis is age-dependent, yet not all molecular subtypes are clearly affected by this relationship. For <40-yr-old women, NM is a major cause for shorter survival. When stratified by subtype, the strongest associations were in HR+ groups, suggesting a possible hormonal connection between young age of breast cancer onset and NM.

                              For several cancers, including those of the breast, young age at diagnosis is associated with an adverse prognosis. Although this effect is often attributed to heritable mutations such as BRCA1/2, the relationship between pathologic features, young age of onset, and prognosis for breast cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we highlight links between age of onset and lymph node metastasis (NM) in US women with breast cancer.

                              Case listings from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) 18 registry data for women with breast cancer, which include information on race, were used. NM and its associated outcomes were evaluated for a subset of women with receptor subtype information and then compared against a larger, pre-subtype validation set of data from the same registry. Age of diagnosis was a 5-category variable; under 40 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years and 70+ years. Univariate and adjusted multivariate survival models were applied to both sets of data.

                              As determined with adjusted logistic regression models, women under 40 years old at diagnosis had 1.55 times the odds of NM as women 60-69 years of age. The odds of NM for (HR = hormone receptor) HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+, and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes were significantly lower than those for HR+/HER2-. In subtype-stratified adjusted models, age of diagnosis had a consistent trend of decreasing odds of NM by age category, most noticeable for HR+ subtypes of luminal A and B. Univariate 5-year survival by age was worst for women under 40 years, with NM attributable for 49% of the hazard of death from cancer in adjusted multivariate models.

                              Lymph node metastasis is age-dependent, yet not all molecular subtypes are clearly affected by this relationship. For <40-yr-old women, NM is a major cause for shorter survival. When stratified by subtype, the strongest associations were in HR+ groups, suggesting a possible hormonal connection between young age of breast cancer onset and NM.

Lymph node metastasis (NM), a means for the regional and distant spread of tumor cells, has a considerable influence upon treatment options and patient survival. Approximately 60% of all newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer are localized (non-metastatic). However, one third of the patients with localized cancers will eventually develop metastatic disease [

                             Breast cancer is distinctive among highly prevalent cancers in that women with a young age of onset often have a more aggressive form of the disease. Although younger women are eligible for more intensive therapy, they nevertheless have, relative to older patients, worse survival and a higher recurrence rate [

                              In depicting the univariate relationship between NM, receptor subtype, and individual covariates, we applied chi-square tests for categorical, and t-tests for continuous p-values. Logistic regression models were constructed for each variable to obtain univariate odds of NM and 95% confidence intervals. To examine whether the effect of age upon odds of NM was modified by receptor subtype, we performed 4 separate, adjusted logistic regression analyses stratified by subtype. Logistic regression modeling was also used to adjust for potential confounding variables, both for full data set and in receptor-based subtype subset analyses. Kaplan-Meier log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the effect of age upon survival and NM. We measured 5-year survival for the similar age categories used in the analyses of Alteri et al. [

                              ]. For 5 separate age category-stratified survival models, we calculated the proportion of hazard of death that was attributable to NM (attributable fraction analysis) by comparing a counterfactual survival function (excluding NM from baseline) to a factual survival function, including NM [

                              Associations with NM were consistent across overall (1975-2017) and subset (2010—2017) analyses and showed that, at diagnosis, 32-36% of women had nodal metastasis of breast cancer. In follow up, women with NM made up a larger proportion of breast cancer deaths, were more African American, had tumors of larger size at diagnosis, and had more distant metastases at diagnosis (

The relationship between age and the adjusted odds of NM had similar estimates for both sets of data. Among all age groups, women under 40 had the highest adjusted odds of NM (1.55 in subset and 1.74 in overall data). Both sets of data confirmed tumor size as being strongly associated with NM. Relative to Whites, African American women had higher adjusted odds of NM (1.13 in subset and 1.23 in overall data). Higher tumor grades were also positively associated with NM, with the effect increasing parallel to the loss of differentiation. See

                              In receptor-stratified data, adjusted estimates of NM by subtype showed that TNBC cancers had lower odds of nodal metastasis relative to the HER2-/HR+ receptor subtype (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.70-0.78) (

Although women 70 years and older had low survival, women under 40 years old began follow-up with survival similarly high with other age categories (40-69 years), but there was a decline starting at ∼15 months which surpassed 70-year-olds at ∼22 months. Women under 40 years of age had the lowest probability of 5-year survival at 0.87, with age groups from 40-69 having similar 5-year survivals at approximately 0.91-0.93, with the value for the oldest group of women slightly decreasing to 0.89. As determined with adjusted Cox analyses, in both sets of data, women younger than 40 also had a higher fraction of hazard of death from cancer (∼50% vs. ∼37% at start) due to NM than women 70 years and above (

                             In adult females younger than 40, there is considerable debate about whether breast cancer should be considered as a distinct disease. Women under 40 have consistently poor survival outcomes across various study populations [

                             ] yet the reasons for this are not fully explained. The present study showed that the odds of NM at diagnosis have a gradient relationship to patient age of onset. This age-decreasing slope is most prominent for hormone receptor-positive subtypes. Findings from survival analysis confirmed that women under 40 have a hazard of death from breast cancer equal to or greater than the next-poorest group, women 70 years or older. Furthermore, the hazard of death attributable to NM was higher in women under 40 years, suggesting that NM has a stronger causal role in breast cancer mortality for younger women as compared to late age of diagnosis survival factors.

                             Previous studies have suggested that a higher incidence of the HR-/HER2+ subtype for young women with breast cancer partially explains their more aggressive disease [

                             ]. Indeed, although our analysis showed a higher proportion of women under 40 years old having the HR-/HER2+ subtype, there was no significant difference in the odds of NM and age among the HR-/HER2+, and HR+ subtypes. However, a study, using a subset of the SEER data shows that, regardless of patients age, the HR+/HER2-breast cancer subtype has a higher rate of lymph node involvement at diagnosis than the triple-negative subtype [
                             <a id="xref-ref-11-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">

                             ]. From this study, NM at diagnosis does not appear to be related to HR-/HER2+ aggressiveness in young age of diagnosis. Furthermore, this observation may be of importance in considering whether prior research examining the link between the HR-/HER2+ subtype and nodal metastasis was adequately controlled for age at diagnosis.

                             The level of generalizability of the SEER 2010-2017 receptor-only subset of data may be questioned as a liability for analysis. We evaluated how representative subset data was using the complete, 42-year data. For all the variables common between datasets, both measures of association and measures of effect were consistent across data. Furthermore, we examined whether there was a time trend in proportion of NM positive patients at diagnosis in relation to age group. Interestingly, we found that, for women <40 years, the proportion of NM at diagnosis vs. non-NM remained stable across time at approximately 50%. In women aged 70+, there was a marked split of NM proportion from 50% starting in 1980, decreasing to ∼25% by 2008 (

                             Lastly, there is also a question of consistency in measurement of variables over time. Perhaps the phenomenon of aggressive disease for younger women with breast cancer is influenced by changes in screening and diagnostic practices. From the standpoint of the association between age of diagnosis and NM, we included year of diagnosis as a predictor variable for both sets used for analysis. There was no confounding effect of the year of diagnosis upon the association between NM and age of diagnosis.

                             Involvement of lymph nodes is a key component in decisions for postoperative therapy, particularly radiation therapy, because clinicians evaluate need for lymph node radiation to minimize toxicity of treatment. Therefore, our results showing that the higher incidence of NM in young (<40 years) HR+ breast cancer groups (HR+/HER2- and HR+/HER2+) is clinically relevant. This relationship between NM and age of diagnosis is clear in women with luminal tumors, and may explain observations from previous studies linking the luminal subtype, young age of diagnosis, and poor prognosis [

                             Our results suggest that a predisposition towards more severe breast cancer for women with younger age of diagnosis is driven in part by NM. This relationship between NM and age of diagnosis for women with luminal tumors is strong and may be related to a poor prognosis. These findings also have implications in identifying high-risk, young HR+ groups (HR+/HER2- and HR+/HER2+) of breast cancer patients for aggressive therapy.
