  <meta name="DC.Description" content="The ongoing NewTics study examines children who have had tics for less than 9 months (NT group), a population on which little research exists. Here, we further investigate relationships between subcortical shape and tic symptom outcomes. 187 children were assessed at baseline and a 12-month follow-up: 88 with NT, 60 tic-free healthy controls (HC), and 39 with chronic tic disorder or Tourette syndrome (TS), using T1-weighted MRI and total tic scores (TTS) from the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale to evaluate symptom change. Subcortical surface maps were generated using FreeSurfer-initialized large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping, and linear regression models were constructed to correlate structural shapes with TTS while accounting for co-variates, with relationships mapped onto structure surfaces. We found the NT group to have a larger right hippocampus compared to healthy controls. Subsequent analyses including clinical symptoms revealed a significant correlation between the future worsening of tic symptoms and a larger pallidum and thalamus at baseline. Surface maps illustrate distinct patterns of inward deformation (localized volume loss) in the putamen and outward deformation (localized volume gain) in the thalamus for the NT group compared to healthy controls. We also found distinct patterns of outward deformation in almost all studied structures when comparing the TS group to healthy controls. In the significant vertices of this comparison, the caudate further exhibited an overall trend of outward deformation compared to the average template in the TS group compared to both the NT group and controls. When comparing the NT and TS groups, the NT group showed consistent outward deformation in the caudate, accumbens, putamen, and thalamus. Since the NT group has had tics only for a few months, we can rule out the possibility that these subcortical volume differences are caused by living with tics for years; they are more likely related to the cause of tics.

Subsequent analyses including clinical symptoms revealed a significant correlation between the future worsening of tic symptoms and a larger pallidum and thalamus at baseline. Surface maps illustrate distinct patterns of inward deformation (localized volume loss) in the putamen and outward deformation (localized volume gain) in the thalamus for the NT group compared to healthy controls. We also found distinct patterns of outward deformation in almost all studied structures when comparing the TS group to healthy controls. In the significant vertices of this comparison, the caudate further exhibited an overall trend of outward deformation compared to the average template in the TS group compared to both the NT group and controls. When comparing the NT and TS groups, the NT group showed consistent outward deformation in the caudate, accumbens, putamen, and thalamus. Since the NT group has had tics only for a few months, we can rule out the possibility that these subcortical volume differences are caused by living with tics for years; they are more likely related to the cause of tics. These observations constitute some of the first prognostic biomarkers for tic disorders and suggest localized circuitry that may be associated with outcome of tic disorders.

                             The ongoing NewTics study examines children who have had tics for less than 9 months (NT group), a population on which little research exists. Here, we further investigate relationships between subcortical shape and tic symptom outcomes. 187 children were assessed at baseline and a 12-month follow-up: 88 with NT, 60 tic-free healthy controls (HC), and 39 with chronic tic disorder or Tourette syndrome (TS), using T1-weighted MRI and total tic scores (TTS) from the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale to evaluate symptom change. Subcortical surface maps were generated using FreeSurfer-initialized large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping, and linear regression models were constructed to correlate structural shapes with TTS while accounting for co-variates, with relationships mapped onto structure surfaces. We found the NT group to have a larger right hippocampus compared to healthy controls. Subsequent analyses including clinical symptoms revealed a significant correlation between the future worsening of tic symptoms and a larger pallidum and thalamus at baseline. Surface maps illustrate distinct patterns of inward deformation (localized volume loss) in the putamen and outward deformation (localized volume gain) in the thalamus for the NT group compared to healthy controls. We also found distinct patterns of outward deformation in almost all studied structures when comparing the TS group to healthy controls. In the significant vertices of this comparison, the caudate further exhibited an overall trend of outward deformation compared to the average template in the TS group compared to both the NT group and controls. When comparing the NT and TS groups, the NT group showed consistent outward deformation in the caudate, accumbens, putamen, and thalamus. Since the NT group has had tics only for a few months, we can rule out the possibility that these subcortical volume differences are caused by living with tics for years; they are more likely related to the cause of tics. These observations constitute some of the first prognostic biomarkers for tic disorders and suggest localized circuitry that may be associated with outcome of tic disorders.

                             Previous such studies have also primarily focused only on TS (diagnosed chronic tics) and control samples. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the identified differences reflect an underlying cause of tics or secondary changes due to prolonged tic presence. Examining participants at the onset of tic symptoms will more likely lead to identifying biomarkers related to the primary cause of tics.

                             In the present study, we further investigated neurobiological characteristics and predictors of tic disorders by examining relationships of the shape of these subcortical structures with tic symptom outcomes (NT) and with diagnosis (NT, TS, and tic-free controls). Three-dimensional surface analysis can detect subtler or more localized volumetric changes that are not revealed in whole-structure, scalar volumetric analysis [

                             We predicted that baseline volumes would differ across NT, TS, and control groups, and that subcortical shape would demonstrate distinct patterns of shape deformation in tic disorders. We further predicted that we would find distinct regions of shape deformation in subcortical structures at baseline that predict clinical outcome in terms of tic severity changes after one year. We also tested whether shape deformation analyses would confirm the previous finding that hippocampal volume predicted symptom severity outcome, using a 3D method in an expanded sample.

                              Data processing began with the use of the FreeSurfer (version 6.0.0) software’s probabilistic voxel-based classification, which provided initial subcortical segmentations [

Surfaces of the hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, pallidum, and nucleus accumbens), and thalamus were automatically generated for each participant using multi-atlas FreeSurfer-initialized large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (FS+LDDMM), which utilizes automated brain segmentations based on multiple template images and allows for image alignment and intensity normalization to produce smooth transformations for each region of interest [

The edited segmentations were then re-processed via LDDMM to yield accurate maps to be included in subsequent surface analyses.

To calculate the (one-dimensional) scale factor, we used the formula: (Population TIV / Individual TIV)? * Voxel Resolution.

                             Surface analyses demonstrated distinct patterns of subcortical surface deformation in several structures across all group comparisons. When comparing the NT group to healthy controls, we found that the putamen exhibited inward deformation (i.e., localized volume loss), while the thalamus showed outward deformation (localized volume gain). Upon comparing the TS group to healthy controls, we found that structures consistently showed patterns of outward deformation in the TS group, found significantly in almost all of the studied structures, including the hippocampus, caudate, accumbens, putamen, thalamus, and pallidum. Similarly, we also found that this pattern was present when comparing the NT group to the TS group, with the NT group showing consistent patterns of outward deformation in the caudate, accumbens, putamen, and thalamus.

                               Children in the NT group had larger right hippocampal volume compared to healthy controls. Further, the NT group also exhibited localized volume increases compared to the TS group. The hippocampus plays a role in memory consolidation in both the cognitive and motor domains [

In a study on patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a larger right hippocampus was significantly associated with higher visuospatial memory scores on the Rey’s complex figure test, which measures visuospatial ability and memory [

                               ]. Furthermore, in a study on the effects of traumatic brain injury in the hippocampus, damage to the right hippocampus correlated with lower memory scores on the Rey’s complex figure test [

                               ]. Our conjecture is that damage here impairs visuospatial ability and memory, and abnormal enlargement may conversely lead to abnormal preservation of visuospatial memory. There is evidence that in children with TS, those with more persistent motor memory show more severe tics, as they were found to take longer to unlearn a previously learned motor pattern [

When analyzing shape differences, we found significant patterns of localized volume increases in NT children compared to TS children in all four structures. However, the putamen in the NT group exhibited localized volume loss when compared to healthy controls, but this deformation was concentrated towards the posterior end. Additionally, the TS group exhibited localized volume increases in the caudate, accumbens, and putamen when compared to healthy controls. In the significant vertices found in the TS-HC surface comparison of the caudate, we found an overall trend of outward deformation compared to the average template in the TS group compared to both the HC and NT groups.

The pallidum and thalamus both showed more consistent activation in free-to-tic conditions.

                               These new findings have potential clinical relevance, and continuing to investigate neuroanatomical characteristics in TS/CTD may further provide insight into prognostic biomarkers. In many children with Provisional Tic Disorder, tics improve within the first year, often to the point of clinical insignificance. Understanding the mechanisms related to these outcomes may provide clinical insight into the pathophysiological traits in tic disorders and thus potentially lead to improved treatment approaches. In a previous memory study, multiple-session stimulation increased functional connectivity among cortical-hippocampal network regions and simultaneously improved associative memory performance [
